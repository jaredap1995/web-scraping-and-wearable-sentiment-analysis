# Amazon Wearable Tech Reviews Scraper

This project harnesses the power of Node.js, Puppeteer, and the Bright Data Proxy Browser to scrape thousands of product reviews of different wearable technologies from Amazon. The inspiration and initial code template for this project was sourced from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo_fUjb02ns

The scraper will start scraping Amazon for reviews of wearable technology products, and the scraped data will be saved in a JSON file in the project directory.

This data provided from this script will be used to perform a detailed sentiment analysis on various wearable technology products for market research, revealing which features are most frequently praised and which ones could use some improvement. More use cases for the data including a type of vector database are being workshopped. 

## Features

- Efficiently scrapes thousands of reviews with the use of Bright Data Proxy Browser.
- Uses Puppeteer, a powerful browser automation tool, to interact with the Amazon website just like a human user would.

## Coming Soon
- Performs sentiment analysis on the collected reviews to identify commonly praised and criticized product features.
- Streamlined process that allows users to select their product of interest and allow the script to run in the background without user interaction.
