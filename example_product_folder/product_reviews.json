        "text": "A bit of background of my reasons for purchasing this product: I recently gained weight while recovering from surgery. In addition, I work from home, so I've developed a sedentary lifestyle recently. The Fitbit was a method of keeping myself accountable for my actions, movements, and goals. Did I walk today? How am I sleeping? Am I moving enough to raise my heart levels? How is my stress? Was I active this week?\n\nThe Fitbit charger does a great job of answering these questions while also telling the time. It can track my movements without the constant ping of my phone continuously going off. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as other smartwatches, so its main focus is primarily exercise.\n\nA few things I like:\n1. The app is great, I love seeing my sleep score, fitness level, and using it for overall progress\n2. The watch is so lightweight, sometimes I barely notice it's there.\n3. The battery life is great, I usually charge it whenever I shower so I haven't seen it drain (although I shower daily)\n4. There's an Alarm on the watch! It does a better job of waking me up than my phone.\n5. The tracking is very accurate. I sometimes panic when I don't feel the watch on my wrist because I want to make sure I moved any given day.\n\nA few things I dislike:\n1. Pairing this device with the mobile app is a pain. I had Fitbits in the past, and it pains me to see that pairing has not changed since then.\n2. The classifications of activities seem off. Since I'm using VR for some fitness activity, the mobile app incorrectly identifies one activity as swimming, and the app will not allow users to change the exercise classification. In addition, it does not identify boxing, so it sees it as a general Sports category.\n3. The wristband should be renamed to waste band because it's awful. I had to look for a 3rd party wrist strap to replace the current one. Would not recommend the default band for comfort absolutely feel the Fitbit team should be ashamed for putting a product out there with a strap that comfortable.",

The remedy is I can buy another band which is ridiculous.. they should provide one that does not cause medical episodes. This watch was a mothers day gift and that is what makes this even sadder is that I will return it and have my son buy another brand, on top of that the watch keeps logging off and the screen asking me to input a credit card keeps popping up and I must play with it to get to the screen with just the time.. seriously there are 20 dollar tracker options that do this and have apps you do not have to pay for subscriptions. The best part of my experience is when I called customer service, because being a gift for mother day... I will forever hate you fitbit for making me return this.... I get the guy from India that cannot understand me and making me go over and over my email address.. there is a long haul of silence so it must be some artificial intelligence interpreting for him and of course things get lost in translation so I asked for a native speaker and he told me I had to hang up and call again and see what I get...YES THAT THE ANSWER.

After just 9 months of use, this so-called \"premium\" fitness tracker has turned into a complete nightmare. The device is plagued with multiple issues that render it practically useless.\n\nFirstly, the display of my Fitbit Charge 5 started exhibiting random horizontal lines, making it difficult to read any information on the screen. This defect significantly impairs the functionality of the device and makes it frustrating to use on a daily basis.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the battery life of the Fitbit Charge 5 has taken a nosedive. Instead of lasting for the promised week, the battery drains completely in a mere 12 hours. This means that I have to charge it constantly, interrupting my tracking and defeating the purpose of having a fitness tracker in the first place.\n\nWhen I reached out to Fitbit support in hopes of finding a solution, they acknowledged the device's malfunctioning but astonishingly refused to replace it because I had purchased it through Amazon. This blatant disregard for customer satisfaction is unacceptable, especially considering the premium price I paid for this device.\n\nThinking that Amazon, renowned for its customer service, would come to my rescue, I contacted their support next. Unfortunately, I encountered a similar response. Amazon not only washed their hands of the problem but also pointed me back to Fitbit for any resolution. It's disheartening to see both companies shifting blame instead of taking responsibility for selling a faulty product.\n\nI implore anyone considering purchasing the Fitbit Charge 5 to steer clear of Amazon as their purchase platform. It's evident that both Fitbit and Amazon are unwilling to stand behind their products or provide any form of satisfactory customer support. Save yourself the frustration and potential loss of hard-earned money by purchasing this device directly from a trusted retailer or exploring alternative options.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fitbit Charge 5 has proven to be an unreliable and poorly supported device. Its faulty display and abysmal battery life, coupled with the lack of assistance from Fitbit and Amazon, have left me feeling cheated and utterly dissatisfied with my purchase. Avoid the Fitbit Charge 5 on Amazon at all costs.",

Sometimes it measures the distance well, sometimes it's off (compared with car-measured and google maps--it reported 6.4 miles where the other two give 5.4, quite a gap). The notifications that pop up during the run are annoying, kindergarten-style nice job, well done, \"you are in cardio zone\", and they are difficult to read on the small screen in bright daylight. I did not find a way to get rid of them.\n\nThe other features are not impressive. Sleep tracking is spotty at best, and you have to wear the tracker on your wrist while sleeping, which I found awkward. So to measure sleep quality, you have to give up on it from the start!\n\nTo get inactivity/exercise reminders, you have to wear the tracker all the time, which after a while also becomes a bother.\n\nThe payment feature is redundant because it requires entering the phone pin code using virtual rolling wheels (difficult when at the register) AND the phone nearby. However, if the phone is nearby, I can pay with the phone. Alarms and timers? -- As though there aren't enough of them around already.\nThe tracker can receive notifications from the phone when close to it--but who needs them when the phone is nearby! Luckily, they can be disabled.",

I have three complaints about this latest version: 1) They removed the tracking of “stairs” which was a feature that I liked. 2) Once again they changed the charging cable which means that older cables are not useful as extras and travel. 3) The new band is horrible!! Why they feel the need to change a good product to a lesser product is beyond me. I will use this one until it wears out, but I will be looking for another product when it needs to be replaced.",

My mom (50F) also uses a Charge 5, although a bit more intensively than I do, as it's been helpful with her weight loss journey.\n\nHOWEVER — if you buy it, spare yourself some pain and buy different wristbands. I've switched to a fabric one and it works much better. I only take my FitBit off to charge or when I'm showering, so when I went to take it off the other day I noticed a patch of REALLY irritated, red, and almost blister-y skin RIGHT where the end buckle sits against my wrist. I don't wear my device tightly at all, I keep it comfortably secure as per the instructions to get a good reading. I would likely pass it off as a \"me thing\" had my mom not come to me this morning to show me HER near-blistered wrist (unknowing that I had the same problem)!\n\nSo yeah, LOVE my FitBit and have no qualms with the device itself!

It took a bit to get used with the new features of the tracker and on the App (which is great). Each morning I check my stats from the previous day on the App when that's when I saw there were NO Steps recorded. How could this be, was there a malfunction, but diving into it a bit more, I realized there was NO altimeter on this model, how could I miss this (Fitbit really doesn't highlight this either)? It's my fault for not noticing it, but it's almost like when you buy a car, you expect to get a radio, for most, it's just expected and this was my frame of mind. I know some don't really care about the steps and/or altitude gain, but it was my single most important stat that I looked at after many of my long, altitude intensive hikes. The personal joy of going over 4000' + (or any decent altitude gain) on a hike was more than personally satisfying. This had to be a marketing decision and certainly not a technical decision. I have read some weren't satisfied with the accuracy of the altimeter, but after using my Charge 2 for 6 years on some pretty epoch hikes, it wasn't that bad either. Anyway, after reading some of the feedback from the Fit Bit marketing people, I think they really don't care and that's their decision, I just wish they would have made it crystal clear they were taking off a feature that had been on this model since it came out, I believe. Other than that, the tracker and App are super, (though the band is a bit tricky to get used to, but not a big deal). My bad for not doing more 'intensive' research and I'll learn to live without the altitude feature but honestly, I would not have purchased this model had I known clearly it didn't have this function, that's why the 4 instead of 5 star....",

Beyond that, the company seems to have paid more attention to the marketing material than the capabilities of the watch.\n\nThe good:\n- Excellent battery life. A daily charge during my morning shower is enough to keep the watch topped up.\nComfortable, with a wide variety of bands available.\n- Easy to read display.\n- Pedometer appears to be accurate and consistent.\n- Mobile app works well and provides interesting insights.\n- Numerous display options available to download.\n\nNot yet tested:\n- GPS capability that tracks time, distance, and pace seems like a useful feature. I haven't used that feature yet, but it is a standard capability of many similar devices and I expect it works well on this watch.\n\nNeeds work:\n- Device must be double tapped to illuminate. Although the company claims the display will illuminate with a turn of the wrist, in my experience no amount of turning, twisting, twitching, flailing, or flapping will reliably cause illumination. Fortunately, double tapping works reliably (though it is bad form in meetings).\n- Automatic exercise recognition works well for walking but doesn't discriminate between a stroll along a level path and a challenging climb through the hills. Lawn mowing is recognized as \"Outdoor Biking\". Yard work sometimes is recognized as \"Sport\". Occasionally weight training is recognized as \"sport\" as well, but generally it is ignored. That isn't surprising, since the unit of measure for \"Weights\" is \"laps\" and I don't do laps while weight training. Kayaking logs in as \"Sport\" as well, which is as good as anything.\n- Sleep measurements are fascinating and generally seem to capture my sleep patterns, but at least once a week are off by several hours. Did I really sleep only three hours those nights?\n\nBottom line: Measurement of exercise and sleep are inconsistent at best. However, this is not a device designed to provide medical-grade assessment of metabolism or health. Even with its inconsistent data capture, it will highlight trends that could be useful guides to behavior modification. Keep your expectations low, and you will be happy with this device.",

        "text": "I like the idea as well as *most* of the execution of the Fitbit. I personally find the sleep tracker great. From a workout perspective, having the GPS built in as well as heart rate and step metrics is fantastic. From there, I have found some unfortunately infuriating aspects to the Fitbit experience:\n\n1. Construction quality\n\nFor some initial backstory, I had a Charge 4 and really liked it. It stopped working within the warranty period and they sent me a replacement. Then the wristband broke. They sent me a replacement for that. Then the BODY of the Charge 4 itself disintegrated and there was no longer a way to attach the wristband and so the device was useless. I was out of warranty by this time, so my hope was that if I upgraded to the Charge 5 just this once, then I might be into calmer waters.\n\nSo I buy the Charge 5. Here I am 7 months later, and while the wristband actually seems to be holding up, the device itself just stopped working. Looking at the back I can see that moisture has seeped into the sensor area. Again, they are sending me a replacement.\n\n3. Workout details\n\nRunning - I would be extremely surprised if there's a single runner on the Fitbit design or product management teams. I've had multiple Timex Ironman watches over the years. They all report times down to the millisecond, provide splits as you see fit, etc. Fitbit does a reasonable enough job tracking your times while you're actually running, but when you go to look at the details later in the app, you don't get the full overall time. At best, you get hours and minutes. This may seem like splitting hairs to some, but runners (and swimmers) are a generally fastidious bunch and we want our seconds and milliseconds. In addition, there doesn't appear to be a way to see a breakdown of your splits across dimensions other than a mile. It's using GPS - unleash our data for us so that we can get down in the statistical weeds like an MLB announcer.\n\nDay of Week - This is a bit of a nit, but the workout history only shows the day of month, not the day of week. I'm not a calendar over here. Show me the calendar day AND the DOW so I can quickly compare performance week-over-week at a glance.\n\nCompare workouts over time - I used Endomondo for years and absolutely loved that app until it was finally retired a year or 2 ago. You could very efficiently compare week over week workout stats and details in the app. You could even filter on specific activities and get a roll-up weekly and monthly summary of things like total time and mileage. You'd even get notifications and reports about things like personal records for things like distances, times, and overall duration. Fitbit has none of this. It's like scrolling through a never ending Instagram feed - no purposeful direction other than the thing currently staring back at you. I see that there may be some way to link this up with Strava, but I'd really like an integrated and seamless experience that doesn't require special import/export hacks. Let me start a workout on my watch, and be off!\n\n4. Zone notifications\n\nI made this a special section because it's so utterly intrusive. It's like when you accidentally click on one of those click-baity websites, start scrolling, and little ads start popping up over top of what you're trying to read on the top, bottom, left and right. So, I'm in the middle of a run or workout and want to check my time, heart rate, or any other stat for that matter, and up pops \"You're in Cardio! Keep it up!\" Good, great, now get out of my way! Tap, double tap, swipe, flick my wrist, intimidation - NONE of these things gets rid of the notification! It's just there, in your way, for a solid 10 seconds or more. This makes normal training annoying. It makes interval/fartlek training damn near impossible. Your heart rate in those cases is ALL over the place. Last but not least, sometimes I go to stop my workout and the screen suddenly becomes non-responsive. Then BAM, that darn notification pops up in the way and I can't stop my run time until it decides to go away.\n\n5. Support\n\nSupport is OK. At least they will replace devices without too much effort. It probably depends on the type of problem you're having, but with my Charge 4 they refused to send me a replacement until they shipped me a return envelope and I returned the broken device. It was weeks before I had a working watch again. With the Charge 5, they seemed to have scrapped this process and now ship out replacements immediately. Much appreciated!\n\n6. Fitbit Community Feedback Utility\n\nI don't use the community much, but I had hoped that I could get some product manager to take a look at some improvements for running experience for the watch and app. A month or more went by when someone finally responded. All they had to say was \"put your request over here instead.\" Funny enough, I had put my request in this specific area because I saw someone else make the same thread in a different area and the Fitbit team told them to put the thread where I had put mine.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I'm OK with the fitbit for now, but I still find it lacking for anyone other than extremely casual athletes. I think a good portion of the problems are simply lack of investment in development resources for the app itself. The remainder are due to major remaining issues with quality. I'm hoping better app and firmware updates on the horizon, but until then I'll be seriously looking for a better replacement. Something like a cross between a Timex Ironman, Fitbit, and Strava or Endomondo.",

Here is the fastest way to do it: Turn off the Blue Tooth on your phone. Wait 15 seconds. Return to \"settings\" on your phone and disconnect the charge 5. State that you are unpairing it. Wait a bit and then go to the fitbit app where you will be asked if you want to connect your Charge 5 with the application. Say yes, then wait. Stare at the long slow line which says \"App is taking a while to sync; hang tight\". Wait some more. If you don't stare at the phone the app will disappear. Reopen the app. It will ask you if you want to link your Charge 5. Say yes.\nThen read your results. Getting them takes a full 10 to 15 minutes from start to finish.\n\nYesterday--24 hours ago-- my Charge 5 had a 19% battery charge; so I recharged it as I do every day. This morning after going through the hassle of getting my readings, the battery was down to 12%. It was as close as possible to 99% before I went to bed.\n\nI am watching my oxygen saturation or I would have returned this within a week.\nIt's like being in a terrible marriage to a partner who does not show up for you without a long struggle.",

        "text": "Through the years I owned every version of the Fitbit Charge Tracker and it still remains my choice, the best option given features, size, comfort, price and durability (usually a Fitbit lasts me until I cannot longer buy replacement bands).\nI have tiny wrists and although I would love to try the smartwatches from Fitbit, they are incredibly bulky and uncomfortable. Truth be told, even the Charge is a little too big on me, but it's the smallest Fitbit product with Heart Rate monitor and sleep tracker.\n\nWhat I dislike about the Charge 5 is that they removed stair tracking and that they track `Active Minutes` based on heart rate zones, not just being active. I do lots of walking and hiking, so I might end up with a 5-6 hours hike but no `Active Minutes` because my heart rate was 90-110 during the hike.\nI also dislike the wastefulness of getting both the S & L bands, there should be an option to only get one. I'll never use the L bands, even on the tightest loop the tracker would fell off my hand.\n\nOtherwise the tracker is pretty decent at tracking sleep, although 1-2 times a month it won't track a night of sleep at all, although I clearly had a good and restful one.\nIt picks up runs, HIIT workouts and the elliptical fairly easily without me starting the activity.\nIt's fairly accurate with step tracker, but as most fitness tracker you can easily trick it to add steps by punching the air or moving your hand vigorously.\n\nThe Daily Readiness Score is an useless feature to me. I had awful days with a good score and awful days with a fair score; I see zero correlation between that score and my stress level. But I didn't purchase it for this feature.\n\nThe skin temperature variation and heart rate monitor are from my perspective spot on. It always amazes me how I can use the Fitbit data to know 2-3 days in advance if I get a cold or infection.\n\nGPS is fairly accurate, maybe a few feet off during my runs, but usually it shows me on the right streets / trails.\n\nFrom my perspective the Fitbit Charge is very comfortable. I only take it off while I shower (and take this time to charge it) and it never caused my irritation, even on hot sweaty workouts. Since I charge it each time I shower, I don't think I ever saw the battery under 80%, so I can't state how long it lasts on it's own.",

Hey, the O2 sensor to track your oxygen level while sleeping is nice, assuming that it's accurate, but I'd give that up to have the altimeter back. If they don't add the altimeter back, I'm switching to a different fitness tracker, and never looking back.\n\nAlso, the heart rate sensor counts much lower than my real heart rate when I'm working out. The Charge 2 had the same issue, so they maybe used the old sensor that needed improvement (140-150 actual, and reading 95-105 is crazy). At rest, it's pretty close.",

Things seemed to be going fairly well for the next few months... until I made the fatal mistake of getting it wet.\n\nNow mind you, the Charge 5 is rated to be water resistant up to 50m, but apparently it couldn't handle the little 1.5m hotel pool I swam in because the screen went dead afterwards. I did a quick search and tried several of the suggested fixes that I found online; nothing worked. I finally contacted Fitbit directly and spoke with a representative. For the next 2 hours the rep goaded me into performing one diagnostic chore after another. She even went so far as to request that I record a video of me doing a hard reset of the device (that I then had to compress so that I could upload it for her to see). It was all a monumental waste of time, but I jumped through every hoop she threw up because I sensed that they were doing everything they could to wiggle out of honoring their warranty and I didn't want to give them any excuses.\n\nWell, finally even the faithful Fitbit rep had to admit that the device must really, truly be defective. Then came the final insult. She asked me to upload a copy of my Amazon invoice. I did so. A few seconds later the rep declares that she's sorry, but they can't replace my device because I didn't buy it \"from an authorized reseller.\" At this point I'm out of patience and ask her what she's talking about since I just showed her my Amazon invoice. Ahh, but that's the problem: the device wasn't sold directly by Amazon itself, but rather a 3rd-party reseller using Amazon's marketplace!\n\nSo there's the \"gotcha.\" Doesn't matter that I bought a brand-new factory-sealed Fitbit device on Amazon that I've been successfully using to connect to their services for the past 5 months; because it wasn't sold directly by Amazon, they refused to fix/replace their shoddy product. Mind you, nowhere on their product page does it say anything about a warranty only being honored if sold by authorized resellers. I don't doubt for one second that that omission is by design.\n\nPeople, this world is full of incompetent and/or unscrupulous businesses that screw things up then duck accountability like a disease, making all our lives harder than they have to be. What should have been a simple diagnose-and-replace warranty operation turned out to be a 2-hour ordeal that ended with a silly fine-print technicality that you won't find unless you stumble upon the right link on their web page. Those are the kinds of two-bit, penny-pinching, money-grubbing shenanigans I'd expect from some off-brand upstart competitor, not from a company with the brand recognition of Fitbit.\n\nI am not a reactionary person, but I can comfortably say that I will never buy a product from nor use the services of Fitbit ever again. And if you're a consumer who values integrity and accountability when dealing with businesses, I'd advise that you avoid them as well.",

However since the last update everything seems to depend on exercise mode. If I were to forget to turn on exercise mode and do any sort of exercise including intense sports like hockey, it barely registers any zone minutes and if I look at it the HR displayed is usually about half of reality. On the other hand, now if exercise mode gets activated accidentally (or I forget to turn it off) I burn insane amounts of calories and zone minutes while doing nothing. I've had this happen over and over. One time it got turned on in my sleep and I somehow got 300 zone minutes while getting a nights sleep (mind you, I have no heart issues). It's also happened while taking a nap on the couch. Or just getting an extra 100 zone minutes while sitting on the couch for an hour after a workout. I wish that exercise worked this way but it doesn't. Why did Fitbit decide that the device needed to cheat via using exercise mode as the primary determination? It was working fine before the update.

It can be up to 30 or 40 BPM off, always lower than my actual rate, measured by the workout equipment I'm using. This makes the calorie counts inaccurate, and pretty much defeats the whole purpose of owning one of these. It's frustrating that the main feature of this watch doesn't work as it should. I could be at a full run and it will say my heart rate is 90-100bpm, which is just wrong.\n\nI like the smartphone app that you use with it, although you have to pay $9.99 a month to get the most out of it, which seems a bit ridiculous on top of how much it already costs to buy the watch. The sleep tracking seems pretty good.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this model. Maybe other models are better, but I'm going to go with a different brand when I replace this watch.\n\nUPDATE: The watch screen has become intermittently non-functional. Battery drains much faster.

For instance, mine has not recorded sleep data for the last three nights. Ir also less frequently fail to record steps also. This situation has occurred several times over the six months I have had it. Needless to say that if it isn't recording data reliably, is isn't very useful as a fitness tracker. (Before someone chimes in, yes, I have tightened the band but these gaps still happen.)\n\nEdit 5/27/23\nNow, in addition to losing contact with my wrist sporadically, my Charge 5 will only charge when it's in the mood. Today I put it on to charge and it went from 93% charge to only 97% in four hours, an unacceptable charge rate.

Seeing that this product has the ability to connect and sync with fitness apps like Echelon and Strada, it was a good choice over more expensive smart watches with extra features I didn't really need.\n\nHowever, I discovered within the first two weeks that the functionality I was looking for seldom works. My exercises from Echelon Fit stopped appearing after 1-2 sessions. When I looked for a support solution their answer was plainly simple to \"remove the authorized app and then re-add it\", which then allows the sync to function one or two more times before it fails again.\n\nSo realizing that I wasn't going to be able to reliably use that feature, I was expecting the Fitbit Charge 5 to use the SmartTrack feature that would automatically record activity, but of course, that was not working either. So I went back to Fitbit support and discovered dozens of posts with the same problem, and supports \"solution\" was to simply restart the device. I tried this twice and it would stop working after 1-2 activities.\n\nSo the primary reason I purchased this device has sporadic, buggy functionality, and \"support\" had very limited ideas for a resolution.

        "text": "I bought this (not from Amazon but direct from the company) because my old Charge 3 wasn't holding a charge for very long anymore. The main thing I use this thing for is to tell time, but I also like the sleep monitoring feature and the alarms. It didn't occur to me to investigate the clock faces on the 5--I figured there would be something acceptable. I like analog. The 3 had an acceptable, simple analog face that I used. Just an hour hand and second hand, easy to read. There is NOTHING like that available on the 5. Most of the faces are numeric/digital, and ugly, ugly. What were these people thinking? It's like being stuck in a Peter Max cartoon. The analog choices--there are only four--are equally horrible and hard to read. One gives you the day of the month taking up about 70% of the screen with a teeny-tiny clock hovering above it. The closest face that remotely resembles an actual watch is pink and looks like it was designed for a 7-year-old girl. Stunningly bad design. I'll add that after four days, I've only gotten a sleep score for two nights. That's a bit disappointing, but I don't know for sure if its a defect or not. The faces, though, are worth complaining about. I wish I'd done more research because I kind of hate this Fitbit.\n\nUPDATE: It's a month later and the sleep tracking function, which was working about 50% of the time, now seems to have completely given up. I'm ready to send this back and would not recommend it to anyone. Too glitchy.",

The only problem is I know it was on my wrist in the uber, just not sure if it came off in the uber or somewhere through security at the airport. I reached out to Fitbit support right away as I waited for the plane to board. I didn't have time to go through the airport to ask TSA or airport information desk if anyone turned in the Fitbit. Fitbit even though I only had the device 2 months, which they should easily be able to tell since they have a serial number and you enroll them online to your account. They would only give me a discount for a new one instead of replacing it. They also can not \"locate\" the tracker via GPS. IE like an airtag, something that an Apple Watch has right out of the gate. I searched \"fitbit charge 5 band falls off\" via google and it comes up with many fitbit community post, reddit post, and other sites where users are having this issue. Yet support still says that GPS doesn't work that way for the to track the device and that warranty can not replace the device.\n\nI just want to make sure everyone that is looking at this device is aware that the Charge 5 has a design flaw with the wristband. As much as I \"clicked\" the wrist band in place it would fall off countless times throughout the week. Research the issues before you decide to purchase this device.",

I recommend getting a strap with some holes if you sweat a lot.\n\nWeek-long battery life with super-fast charging. Takes a considerable hit if you set the GPS to use only the watch versus phone or \"dynamic\" mode.\n\nThe HIT mode is great. You set the durations and number of intervals and it vibrates to cue you through your workout.\n\nPretty good app, but it loves to remind you to get the subscription. There's some oddities like the selection of activity choice, when set by the app, is always, run, walk, and hike, no matter what you can set from your device (which varies by the exact fitbit).\n\nBright, consistently turns on the screen when lifting it up.\n\nAccurate GPS and heart rate. Heart rate will always be better on a chest monitor but this is pretty darn good.\n\nSome decent watch faces and matching always-on options to choose from.\n\nLooks good.\n\nHas NFC payment support.\n\nCons:\nIf used with Android, you can control music and other audio by setting Spotify, Audible and whatever other app to show notifications. It then offers music controls and thumbs up, etc... in the form of replies, like if you were hitting a smiley face to a text message. A DEDICATED MUSIC CONTROL APP WOULD BE MUCH BETTER. This works alright unless you are trying to use this in the middle of exercise. Then it takes a tone of needless steps and is such a pain you're better off doing this on your phone.\n\nUsing this in the snow with wet hands isn't the worst, but tap recognition is definitely inconsistent. Given this has an accelerometer and not just a touch screen, a software update could help it considerably, and even have a glove mode. Not as bad with just sweaty hands but you'll run into similar issues. The lack of buttons makes this comfy, durable, and helps keep it clean, but an update that makes better use of he accelerometer is needed to truly make this work all the time.\n\nThere's an option to vibrate upon hitting heart rate zones. This is a highly-sought after feature by anyone looking to stay in a dedicated zone. Unfortunately, it only seems to vibrate upon going up a zone, not down. Hugely missed opportunity here. Should be one buzz for up, two for down. So close but no cigar.\n\nNo pacer function, like if you want to compete against a previous run/ride and know where you are relative to that run or some average.\n\nGetting more nitpicky:\nNo app to start and stop a gopro or similar.\n\nNo camera control from the watch.\n\nYou can't type or dictate text replies.\n\nNo third-party app support.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nPretty good, but you'll know what you traded for the admittedly comfy and good looking slim form factor of a bracelet shaped tracker versus a watch.",

(I wanted a band--not a watch--so I could wear on my right wrist, as I typically wear a gold watch on my left.) I guess I was hoping for a lot more automation than is available these days. I tried a couple of others, returned them and wound up with the Charge 5. It seems many of them (including Charge 5) can keep a decent count of steps if you go on a walk or run outside. And many of them can measure your heartbeat. But none of them can figure out you're on a treadmill or a rowing machine or doing sit-ups, etc. Maybe a few more years to go before these are really valuable for real-world fitness. Also, I wanted a \"sedentary alert\" -- a vibration on the wrist to let me know I've been sitting at my desk too long. It has one, but its vibration is so short and light, you can barely feel it and easily miss it, especially if you're on the phone or really focused.",

I know this because I can see the difference with the measured rates on the treadmills and cycles that I'm on. I'm confident its a watch problem and not all of the machines being wrong.

Please take the limited longevity of these devices into account when you decide how much you’d like to pay. My Charge 5 lasted 17 months. It’s useless now - can no longer count past 914 steps without resetting to zero. Reinstalling the firmware on the watch and updating the app have no effect. Previously had the Charge 2, the Alta, and another one I can’t recall. They all work pretty well as long as they work. One odd thing about the Charge 5 - either your resting heart rate is bollocks or the amount of time you sleep is. The Charge 5 would often shoot my resting heart rate up by +5 beats a minute overnight and tell me I didn’t sleep at all even though I got a solid 7 hours. It always did better matching my sleep when it also matched my lower resting heart rate. Oftentimes fit bit would show my resting heart rate was well above what it should be - like the device would say my RHR was 57 beats per minute, while I was up and about checking things and my current heart rate read 54 beats per minute or similar. But the charge 5 did seem to count steps pretty well while in the first year or so of ownership. Will try an Apple Watch now as I’d like the functionality of listening to music from the watch and hope the more-expensive Apple product lasts awhile.

I find it helpful to motivate me to exercise, but the website and the app are kind of clunky and looks dated and acts more like a storefront to steer you toward other google devices. There are some useful things that you can track besides your food consumption, but I'm guessing that either the calories from the food producers are off, the number of calories the app says I'm burning per day is off or both are wrong, because even though I've lost weight it isn't coming off like it should. Recently I read a summary of a study that said most fitness devices and apps over-estimate calories burned by as much as 20% so I'm guessing that may be it.\n\nThat said, I can't believe that the app or website doesn't displays the sugars you've consumed in a day. It has all the macros and lists sodium but no sugars. The app forums say that Google removed it. Most everyone on the forums want it back. The 'workaround' is to sync your device with MyFitnessPal which still tracks sugars. Not much of workaround if I need to purchase the premium version of the Google app (to get the tracking features) as well as MyFitnessPal. $180/yr for both? Don't think so.\n\n02-13-2023\n\nUpdate and rating increase. Device is working fine now. Apparently there was a server issue judging by the comments made by users on the Fitbit forums. I'm happy with the device now. The app was a little confusing at first, but I think I have that figured out now. The only thing that still concerns me, and this probably isn't a Fitbit food database issue, is that many of the items I log for my meals during that day have incorrect nutrition facts from the label. A couple of times drastically so. If you submit a food that wasn't included that app has you snap pictures of the label for submission. Much better than MyFitnessPal which last time I used it asked users to type in the data for submission. That said, either that labels have changed or someone foobar'd the data input. Because what I'm seeing isn't matching the current labels. Also, you are able to scan the bar code as you can with MyFitnessPal which is nice for searching for a new meal item.\n\n02-09-2023\n\nBrand new device. Worked well for all of one day and then started having sync issues. Wish I would have gone to the Fitbit community forums first. This seems to have been an issues for quite some time, with many users complaining about the same issue.\n\nI'm using an android phone. Its running version 10. The app has been updated and the device updated. All of the required permissions are allowed. I cleared the cache and force stopped the app. I restarted the app and my phone. I still get sync issues when I manually run one from the app. I am also having issues with the sleep tracking. Out of 4 nights it has only worked well for 1 night. And the setup for your sleep times and when it tracks is a little confusing.\n\nMost of my sync issues are happening when I first get up in the morning. So maybe Fitbit is having backend issues with their servers?\n\nThat said, I do like the features on the device and hope that Fitbit gets the sync issues fixed.",

I can't say how accurate the sleep tracker is exactly but based on my observations about when I know I fell asleep, when I know I was dreaming (REM sleep), when I woke up and fell back asleep, this sleep tracker seems pretty accurate. Im actually impressed.\n\nI like the food tracker as well. I found that apps like myfitnesspal and loseit are easier to use but I like that with the fitbit app I can track all my fitness metrics including food intake. The EKG function seems cool but truthfully for most people its really just a novelty. If you have a normal heartbeat then the fitbit will probably just tell you that you're in normal sinus rhythm. If you have heart problems then I dont think you should trust your life with this.\n\nHeart Rate monitor was very frustrating initially. Works fine if youre walking or at rest but during cardio it became very inaccurate. It would usually be off by 20 bpm or more when compared to my polar chest HR monitor which is very accurate. I tried raising the band up higher on my wrist as fitbit suggests but this really didnt help. Through trial and error I found that for me, it needs to be a bit higher up on the wrist than fitbit suggests and I need to wear the band a little tighter but not too tight. Theres a sweet spot I guess. Eventually I got to where my fitbit heart rate was usually within 5 bpm of my polar chest HR monitor. I dont think its reasonable to expect it to be more accurate than that.",

But once I started using the Charge 5 I will never go back.\n\nMy pros & cons are below, after using this watch for a little over a month.\n\nFirst the Pros:\n- Brilliant display that is so easy to read in any lighting conditions. Huge improvement over the Charge 3!\n- Excellent new health metrics. I love the zone minutes, and these are the most important goal that I use. It's what really matters for fitness! Also has new overnight metrics that are nice though I do not find as useful as the zone minutes. EKG & EDM features I do not use, although some may find value in these apps.\n- Very user friendly menus and displays. Much improved!\n- Smoother lines and nice feel. The Charge 5 is more comfortable and less boxy than the Charge 3.\n- Battery life for me is about 5 ish days. Not bad, however, my Charge 3 was 7-8 days for me. Probably because the display was so dim on the Charge 3.\n- Love the built in GPS that is only used if you select Run or other exercise tracking. Auto detect tracking does not appear to activate the GPS that I am aware of.\n\nCons:\n- Clock faces are not the best in my opinion. Wild art that is either crooked, loud, upside down, etc and really not that useful. Many have very small numbers for tracking heart rates or other metrics. I did find one called Target that is nice. I probably would not have purchased the watch initially without a decent clock face, and was considering Garmin because I did not like the clock faces at the time.\n- Like the Charge 3, this watch struggles to capture accurate heart rates for me when I am on the elliptical. Maybe it's just me, but nothing I do helps except except if I move the watch up my arm. This then captures much of my session, however, half the session shows a heart rate half of what it actually is.\n- I cannot get calendar notifications to work, even though I have that selected. It only notifies me of text messages. I would like it to have calendar notifications so I don't miss meetings or appointments.\n\nThe band is now more like the Apple watch band. Not sure of the benefit of this or if it is better or not vs the Charge 3, so I am impartial to that.\n\nOverall a great health tracker, long battery life, easy to read with some smart watch features like viewing text messages and weather warnings. I recommend without any hesitations!!",

I have tried everything I have read on troubleshooting and NOTHING works.\nI charged my Fitbit before bed last night. It was at 29%. I let it get to 100% before I took it off the charger. I had gotten 11,966 steps that day, so I decided to hit 12,000. I walked all over the house, then checked my watch. It was still at 11,966 and all I could see was the main screen. Try as hard as I might, I could not swipe to another screen. The next time I tried to look at my watch screen I couldn't get it to light up. Not be double tapping it or flicking my wrist. Looking on my app, it showed my battery was dropping fast. In less than 5 minutes it was down to 73% and I could no longer get the screen to light up.\nThis morning it was completely dead and putting it on the charger wouldn't even bring it to life. I tried the 3 presses of the button on the charger, NOTHING! I tried a second charger, NOTHING!\nI'm so disappointed and done with FitBit. Sounds like the 5 is nothing but trouble!",

        "text": "I had two of these. The first died entirely (battery issue) after 4 months. The second died after 6 months of use. And there was about a 2 month gap between the first one dying and the second one arriving. Totaling 12 months and putting a 3rd replacement right out of the warranty period.\n\nI wore it a lot ... like everyday. I usually did not wear it to bed. But when I did, it was interesting to see the sleep analytics.\n\nI mostly wore this to track my milage and pace during running. I think generally it does an okay job with that, but here is where it really fell short (this is with both trackers) ... so this should mitigate getting a dud.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n1/ Though I didn't buy the fitbit for this reason, I appreciated the sleep analysis. I don't like wearing watches to bed, so I only did this about once a week. But every time I appreciated the analytics. Are there better tools for that? Probably, but I never used or had access to a product that did this. Do I need it? Not really. I have very little issues with sleep.\n\n2/ Seeing pacing and heart rate while running and doing workouts was pretty cool. I liked the heartrate features.\n\n3/ Hitting goal milestones grants you a little vibrate on the wrist and celebration graphic. I enjoyed these. (Zone minutes / steps / etc.)\n\n4/ Incoming texts without having to check phone. This was nice, but got annoying sometimes because you might have already cleared out all your phone texts ... and your watch texts are still there. So essentially you have to clear them in two places.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n1/ Standalone GPS drains the battery very fast AND it shuts off after about a mile and says \"GPS not found\". This sort of screws up tracking.\n\n2/ I never actually saw any maps of my runs. I found this to be frustrating, but I understand why fitbit might not want to do that with the GPS being funky.\n\n3/ I got into swimming a lot after having the fitbit for a month. The fitbit does not track laps :( despite it having a swim setting\n\n4/ It tracks bumpy slow car rides (and motorcycle rides) as massive running steps ... Though I only had a few of those days, I didn't find that to be as much a problem as some of the other issues listed.\n\nThere were a few other features like credit card payments via watch, reminders to move if the watch notices you are in a sedentary position too long ... but I never really used these features.\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I would not get one. I paid almost $200 last year for this (price is now down by $50), but I'm just like ... wow. What was I thinking. I recall after it first broke, I went on a camping trip and strapped on my old regular digital watch. I didn't miss the fitbit one bit on that camping trip.\n\nI was super sad when it broke because it was just a few weeks before my first marathon and I thought I was going to be disadvantaged somehow by not having it ... a phone was all I needed to track pace. As a runner, you sort of know how hard to push yourself.\n\nSupport is sticking to the 1 year warranty even though the last replacement was only 6 months old. I don't think this is sticking true to the spirit of the piece of products' quality. They offered me a 35% discount on my next fitbit. I won't use it. Just not really worth the money for me.",

Sometimes when you tap it a notification appears instead of the time and I have not figured out how to remove the notification to see the time. The time does not display seconds. When I workout, I like to time my time between weight sets. Without the seconds displaying I cannot do this. If the seconds did display it would still be a pain because you would have to tap the screen twice to see the seconds. Sometimes it will display after 2 taps sometimes it does not so I have to keep tapping the watch. It does have a timer but that is pain to use also. You to tap the watch to get the display then scroll to the timer and reset it each time. So now I wear the fit bit for step tracking and a standard wristwatch with a second hand to time rests between weight sets. Another thing that completely irritates me is the wrist band. You put the tracker on your wrist and adjust the band. So there is some excess length to the band that normally would go thru a loop and the excess would rest on top of the band. With this fitness tracker the excess band goes thru and loop rests on the bottom of the band right next to your skin. If you have the tracker snug on your wrist it is hard for me to slide the excess of the wrist band underneath against my skin. If my skins is moist it the band won't slide under. While doing this it pulls on the hair on my wrist which is somewhat painful. I mean who came up with that design??? I do not like the tracker it really does not work for me.

I researched why this would happen. I didn’t have a problem with the silicone band on the 4 So no allergic reaction. I read that I should wear it looser, switch arms and take it off to give my wrist time to breathe. I wear it looser and it doesn’t pick up my stats. When I wear it to sleep, it won’t read at all on some nights. I’ve tried resetting it and I still have the problem.\nOverall I’m very disappointed. I can’t return it. I can’t find a band that I like to replace this one. I shouldn’t have to buy a new band. I can’t afford to pick a different Fitbit that might be better. I budgeted for this one for my health. I’m stuck with it for now and probably won’t wear it anymore.\nThen there’s the new charge cable. It’s horrible! It has a magnet that attaches to the Fitbit that’s it. Nothing to hold it stable so it comes off when I set it down or if I move it.",

Charge holds for at least a week, impressive.\n\nReasons for a 4 star vs 5 star rating - I'd give a 3.5 if I could: 1) I want the clock on all the time. The display goes off so fast and it sleeps deeply so I have to tap the crap out of the watch to get it to show me the time. I want it on at all times, yes I know it will reduce battery life. I'd take 50% less battery life over the lack of always-on display (dimmed for light conditions obv). The lack of always-on contributes to me forgetting to start the workout stopwatch, which is kinda the point of a fitness tracker. 2) The number of functions on the display and the mediocre tactile nature of the display make it even harder to focus on workout tracking. I am never going to use Fitbit like an Apple Watch to check-out at a store, come on, nobody is expecting Fitbit to have Apple-level security. This is a fitness tracker, stay focused Fitbit and let me have always on display for all the functions.",

        "text": "I got into weightlifting the beginning of November and decided to get myself a Charge 5. I mostly wanted it for the steps, heart rate, calories, and sleep tracking, so I will start my review based on these features. The steps and heart rate tracking seems to be incredibly accurate. Absolutely no complaints from me here. Calories on the other hand… there’s no question the Fitbit drastically over estimates calories burned from steps. I have a sort of hybrid office job where I’m in the office a lot, but I also have a lot to do around the building as well. The other day, I walked 13,000 steps just from work and it was a rest day so I didn’t work out. My Fitbit tried to claim that between my maintenance calories and steps, I had burned 4000 calories that day. That’s a bit ridiculous. Possibly 3000 but 4000 is most definitely an over estimate and it frequently makes drastic overestimates like this. I will also note that several years ago I lost 60 pounds so I’m pretty familiar with what typical calories out look like for me. I also think it’s important to mention that all fitness trackers have this issue of drastically overestimating calories from steps. It’s just a limitation in the technology currently available. The other thing to mention is the sleep tracking. Overall, it’s great. Recognizes when I fall asleep and seems very accurate. Where it falls short is when I wake up. Let me just give an example of this morning. I woke up to my alarm at 6:30. I got up, put the Fitbit on the charger, and hopped in the shower. I then put my Fitbit back on and proceeded with my morning routine. The Fitbit thought I was still trying to sleep up until 7:20am and counted this in my sleep score as “time awake” at night. It does this nearly every morning. This effects your sleep score by increasing your % of time awake, effectively making your sleep score useless because it’s skyrocketing the minutes spent awake during the night… even though I am very clearly awake for the day and it’s not night any more. Fortunately, I don’t care too much about the score, and I’m more just checking to make sure I got adequate deep sleep for my muscles to recover. But if you are planning on using this to overall grade your sleep and keep track of that, then this is something that would likely be very obnoxious for you.\n\nOtherwise, the watch looks sleek and the band it comes with is comfortable enough where I don’t even notice it most of the time. However, just make sure not to wear the watch too tight or the band definitely can irritate the skin a little.\n\nThe last thing I will talk about is some of the watches more “premium” features. Most of these features are locked behind a monthly subscription. Kind of scummy from Fitbit imo to not be clear about that so I thought I would mention it. If you are getting the Fitbit for any of the reasons I did though, the more basic features mentioned above, then this won’t be an issue as these don’t require a subscription. You do get 6 months of this subscription free with the purchase. Can totally understand the subscription for things like the workouts, meal recommendations, community, ect but putting advertised features of the watch in the subscription is a quick way to lose the trust of your customers.\n\nOverall, the watch is great for everything I need and I’m happy with my purchase despite focusing on a lot of the negatives in this review. I just feel I should point them out for others.",

So after a month or so of down time, Fitbit/Google (now) say it is a known issue fix expected in \"early 2023\"...WTF.\nFitbit did not test compatibility of their App with Android 13.... or at least did not fully test it.\nNegligent/incompetent product management and SW development.\n\nTwo trackers stuck on \"download fitbit app\", is seen/found by the app but never finishes the authentication code exchange in pairing. Absolutely poor product testing prior to release.\nThe error is likely in the Fitbit App as the confirmation code authentication process and exchange failed consistently on both units.\n\nGOOGLE-FITBIT fix the problem you sold us!

I started with a Charge2 and never had any trouble with it, but I broke the crystal and needed a replacement.\n\nEnter the Charge 3. The face was faint but readable. As time went on, the face became more difficult to read. I researched the issue on the Internet and it seems the lack of brightness is a big issue with many. I adjusted the settings to Normal as the article suggested (choice of dark, auto and normal). At its brightest, it still was dim at best. Often I would have to go into settings and choose Normal again and I’d get a more readable display…for awhile. However, one thing was excellent about the Fitbit 3 and that was the ability to easily change bands to a dressier one I purchased. Finally the display went totally black and I could not even find settings to get my usual dim readout.\n\nSo, enter Charge 5. Readout is big and bright! Looks like they got their problem solved, but this time the band is very hard to attach. I had to research attaching a band on a Charge 5 on the Internet and finally got it to stay on, although they seem slightly loose. Yes, I listened for the little click of the little almost impossible to find button as the article said. Again, this issue is wide spread judging by the questions and complaints. But I went ahead and ordered a dressier version band, received it and cannot get one side to “click” at all, so am returning that and I’ll be stuck with the rubber band it came with, which I was lucky I got to stay on. At least until the poorly designed buttons break off. If they had of just kept the band replacement ease of the Charge 3, then they would have a good product.\n\nI would not recommend the Charge 5. I was generous and gave it 3 stars for the bright display. I wouldn’t recommend the Charge 3 either, if it is still available. This will be my last purchase of a fitbit and will switch to Apple.",

Where my phone would count 45 steps, the fitbit wouldn't pick up any of them. Where my phone would count 60 steps, the fitbit would pick up 21.\n\nWhich this might work for some, I work remotely and find it really hard to get my steps so I need something accurate. If I'm constantly going on these long walks feeling proud of my accomplishment and then I get home and realize I actually didn't hit my goals (or at least I think I didn't because the fitbit doesn't track them) I'd get discouraged and stop actively walking which is why I need something accurate.\n\nThe heartbeat feature was spot on. I took my resting heart rate to compare and it was accurate but that's not a good enough product on its own for me.\n\nThe premium membership is a bit weird. The stats are all laid out on the app which is great but the perks that you get with the membership are a bit half assed. For example, they give you 1 minute quick video recipes but don't tell you how much of each ingredient to put into the recipe lolll.\n\nI wouldn't get this if I were you.

They will not pair and sync. This is a known bug, but Fitbit likely won't tell you that. They'll run you through the gamut of troubleshooting steps, driving you crazy, making you feel stupid and frustrated. It won't be until you are smart enough to search their community board that you will find a community of other people with this exact same problem and mention this to tech support that they will admit that yes, they know about it. NOW they tell you! Not cool. There is a work around in which you can pair with a tablet or other phone and sync with the cloud and then sync your flip/fold phone with the cloud, but this is very annoying.

(see problems 2-4)\n\n2nd problem - App said there was a new software patch for the device (not uncommon) so I went ahead and started the upgrade download. And it kept disconnecting. And now, a day later, it is still dropping the bluetooth signal before it has a chance to fully install the new software.\n\n3rd problem - each time it falters on the install, it then tries to do everything over again from scratch. Meaning that while it says it CAN take 40 minutes to install the new software, I have gotten as far as fully downloading the patch and then going to the install step.... but when it hangs up, locks, or drops signal, I then have to download from step one the next time I attempt the upgrade.\n\n4th problem - The device keeps freezing and locks up completely. I am assuming this is something that the newest patch would fix, but I cannot seem to get the patch downloaded and installed to fix it.\n\nWhose bright idea was it to remove the ability to do a hard manual restart on the device? Sure, you can do it from the charging port, IF you are near it. But I am now at work and have been trying to install this patch on my downtime between classes I teach.

In addition to this, the screen is not responsive. I find myself having to poke it several times for it to show the time. I reached out to customer service and they said since I do not sync it often enough (one two twice a week) then they don't have sufficient data to move forward with any help such as replacement, or even just fixing it.",

The auto workout detection is 50/50, and not so accurate. I stopped caring whether or not the watch detected a workout because it was too much of a hassle to fix it. I just cared that when I did work out my heart rate would get into the cardio zone. Battery life is good, although I recharged my Fitbit every night. I didn't wear when I slept because it was simply too uncomfortable. Watch also worked decently during swims. The touch screen is glitchy when exposed to water, but once it dries off it's back to normal.\n\nThe absolute worst part, and what broke the deal for me was the bacteria build-up on the tracker itself (not the silicone band). This, in my opinion, is something Fitbit really needs to work on because it is impossible to disinfect all the tiny crevices surrounding the sensors without dunking it in a bleach solution. If I swim regularly, it's not so bad -- it's when I go several days without swimming and switch to running/jogging that the bacteria gets awful. Even after 2 or 3 days the smell is horrendous. And no, you can't clean it manually. Using a toothbrush and soap isn't enough. Wiping down with alcohol isn't enough. The entire unit needs to sit in disinfectant for several minutes for the smell to go away -- hopefully.\n\nApparently, this is a problem specific to Fitbit and it doesn't happen with other fitness trackers. We'll see, as I've switched to another brand.",

For example, Apple watch was critical for me because I did not have to carry my phone during running and could just download the songs. It also has call reception and message monitoring features. Fitbit is a no frill device meant to do one thing. Track your health. I already have another analogue watch and actually won't mind not receiving messages and calls while I am exercising so that was a fit-bit plus.\n\n2. Fit-bit is unobtrusive. I can wear it along with my analogue watch without looking like a douche bag (which I would if I kept a health monitor on top of a digital watch.

I also usually have to take the Garmin off when I'm typing on the laptop, otherwise the loop catch + holder digs into the bottom of my wrist.

Found the battery life to be more than adequate, the display was easy to read in a variety of conditions, and I felt like it accurately tracked heart rate.\n\nHowever, there were some unacceptable issues with hardware failures and in particular, the design of synchronization with social fitness apps like Strava.\n\nThe Fitbit would occasionally not just drop its own connection to GPS, but getting the GPS information from the phone it was hooked up too. In the middle of high stress workout there was no way to notice this was happening. Even if you did, there was no way to resync the watch on the phone. Each GPS mode produced failures, wiping out 20 or 30 mi bike rides that I've been preparing for and trying to track.\n\nWhen I realized I couldn't trust the GPS, I was still interested in keeping the Fitbit. I would use the sleep tracking and heart rate tracking, but trust the GPS from Strava to track my workouts. Workouts. Unfortunately, Fitbit has removed the ability to treat the charge as a simple heart rate monitor for other applications. So now I was maintaining and charging another device, which would only track 9 out of 10 workouts reliably, that I was willing to use the secondary features for, but it would refuse to send that information anywhere else.\n\nForums and customer service posts boiled down to \"pound sand\".\n\nThere's other problems too. The user interface during a workout isn't particularly helpful. I don't mind some contextual notifications about what zone I'm in, those are actually helpful. Defaulting to something with time is really unforgivable when it comes to something that should really start as a watch.\n\nAll in all, if you're a big Strava user or biker I really wouldn't suggest this heart rate tracker.",

The display is actually visible which is a big change over the Charge 4, however, the battery just dies with no warnings and that is super annoying. Went for a walk today and realized after I started that my Fitbit was completely dead. There are no notifications or indications when the battery gets low so if you don't plug it in every couple of days it will die and you won't know until it happens. Apple Watch would have been a much better purchase but I thought I'd give Fitbit a try again since I like the smaller footprint. Step count and exercise tracking isn't much better than the Charge 4 was and often fails to recognize exercise or has the wrong durations if it does track it. As always, the sleep tracking is pretty worthless. It gives you a general idea of how the night went but of course there are no suggestions or any way to improve your score so I'm not sure what a person is supposed to do with that information. Mobile app still has lots of trouble syncing data and generally takes at least a couple of tries.\n\nAlso, if you are an Apple user I would avoid Fitbit as they are not very compatible. The instructions from Fitbit are to leave the app running all of the time, which is NOT something that Apple devices allow. You can leave it open in standby mode but it won't actually be running and will restart every time you open it either way. Also, apps that are left open in iOS will be closed by the system if you don't do it manually. The system design actually pushes users to close apps regularly so unless you want to spend quite a bit of effort fighting against the device design I'd look at Apple Watch, which is obviously designed to be used with Apple devices.\n\nI finally gave up on Fitbit altogether because not only of the issues noted above but also because the device has a lot of random useless \"apps\" built in and the device quite often gets stuck on a screen for payments or notifications and there doesn't appear to be any way to get out of it (swiping is disabled on these screens apparently). I'll eventually buy an Apple Watch, I just didn't want to spend the extra money but Fitbit is pretty unreliable if you are using it with an iPhone.",

Better battery life. Probably double the Charge 4 in my use cases.\n2. Better GPS functionality, especially when paired with an iPhone12. The Charge 4 was useless in this regard.

        "text": "I've been a Fitbit user for years and I really do like it. Before I got one, I was one of those sporadic exercisers who would start up and then quit a few months later. Fitbit gives me the incentive to exercise 5 or 6 days a week. I started out several years ago when I switched over from a very active patient care job to a computer job. I like the work but it's totally sedentary. I knew I needed to incorporate more walking into my daily routine if I was going to remain slender and healthy.\n\nOnce I started working from home during the pandemic, I needed to ramp up my walking routine. I really don't move much during the workday. I'm 62 and my formerly slender figure was becoming doughy from being immobile behind the computer. So, I decided to get even more serious about walking regularly. I bought a treadmill to keep at home and I get on it every morning before work. I try and take a walk after dinner as well to make up for the lack movement during my workday.\n\nI upgraded to the Charge 5 a few months ago because my previous Charge 3 was getting old. It was really hard to see the screen when I was outdoors in the sunlight. The Charge 5 has a bright, colored screen that is easier for my old eyes to see.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the Charge is their notification feature-\nI usually have my cell phone stashed away in my purse and I don't always hear it. I like that the Fitbit alerts me when I get a call or text. I also use it to track my sleep hours and quality. You'd think at my age I'd know enough to go to bed on time, but I get engrossed in other things. The sleep feature helps me to stay on track.\n\nThe two biggest disappointments I've had with the Charge 5 are:\nMy old charge 3 had a very strong notification buzzer (it had two settings so users could select a stronger or weaker buzz). I liked it on the stronger one. This one doesn't have that option. Oddly enough, the default on the Charge 5 started out strong like my old Fitbit so I was happy but once I updated it, the notification is now weaker buzz. Nothing I can't live with, but I wish they'd give us the choice again.\n\nThe more serious flaw is this:\nI love that I only have to charge the battery once a week on the Chart 5 and it's easier to attach than their old clip. However, several times I've had the battery totally discharge way before it was due to be low. I had to go to their website to try and troubleshoot. Nobody really knew why so I ended up disabling a few features that I don't use often. I'm hoping that solves the issue. If it keeps happening, I'm going to end up buying a different product so I'm hoping Fitbit gets this resolved soon.",

The navigation is not intuitive and, while it has some really wonderful functionality and options, finding and utilizing them is a real struggle (forget trying to interact with the device while you're working out). Fitbit has also included a minimally functional payment app that has a limited number of financial institutions it supports. If the user's bank is not supported or the user simply wants to delete the app, it is not an option and you will constantly have to scroll through a useless app to use the watch.\nThe mobile app is fair. The navigation is not super intuitive and there are options, functions and features what can get lost to the user unless you invest allot of time figuring out the app. They could definitely do better here.

There is no altimeter. For those used to tracking stairs/elevation change while hiking with Fitbits, that is impossible. I had read somewhere that it would estimate stairs based on GPS elevation data - this is NOT true - it will not attempt any kind of stair tracking at all.\n2. If you don't want to give Fitbit your card/bank info for Fitbit Wallet, you'll have the distinct pleasure of getting a vibrating reminder that they want you to add a card every time you open the app to sync. To date, there is no way to disable this reminder.\n\nOther than that, it's good at what it does, nothing mind-blowing but tracks what I want it to.

And it has a lot of features (probably more than necessary for the average user, IMHO).\n\nMy biggest complaint however, is that the FitBit App information on my Android Galaxy S10 screen runs off \"the page\", and resizing the font app to a smaller view simultaneously affects the font size of all other apps like Messages and E-Mails. Not sure if there is a workaround, but doubtful that Fitbit can make their app function independently from the Android phone settings.\n\nAlso and it may just be user error, but I've trained every day (5) this week, yet the app only tracked 3 days.\n\nAdditionally (and this is probably true of most fitness trackers) is that for the fitness/calorie tracking, I'm not really sure just how accurate it is. Seems to be somewhat random. Most days before my feet even hit the floor, the app shows me having walked over 200 steps.\n\nI guess I must be walking in my sleep;-)\n\nThe calorie tracker is really good, though I'm not sure how many people continue using it once the chore/novelty of the feature wears off. You have to be very disciplined. Since I don't consume a lot of daily calories in general, I now only use it to track my water intake.\n\nI'll update my review once I've used the band for a few weeks and have had a chance to work out the kinks...",

I tried wearing both and found the step count was way, way off from charge 4. I switched back to charge 4 and dealt with the battery issues, but as that got worse I switched back again and after a day I am ready to toss charge 5 out again for good. Gonna buy another charge 4.",

For example it routinely shows that I am asleep when I am watching TV - this alone says something about it's ability to go deeper and show different sleep phases, etc. That's pure fantasy. It can't tell the REM and light sleep from just laying awake and tossing or even getting up. I brought it up in a conversation with my sleep doctor and he told me that Fitbit same as other consumer sleep trackers just don't have the right sensors to do detect sleep phases, so shouldn't pay any attention to what it's showing there. From my own observation I tend to trust the 'deep sleep' reading a little bit more, meaning when it shows that I was in 'deep sleep' I read this 'most likely asleep' or at least not moving much.\n- app is pretty buggy, which is frustrating considering that it's been around for a while. Often needs to be restarted to get the charts to update, also gets out of whack if Bluetooth gets turned off and on again. Little things but quite annoying.",

        "stars": "2",
        "text": "I'll try to keep this brief and I'll start with a disclaimer: there's a chance the Fitbit Charge 5 I received was just a dud. I returned it to Amazon but I'm not planning on buying another based on my experience, even if I did just have a defective unit.\n\nThe heart rate tracking just isn't good enough for the kind of exercise I do on a daily basis. I imagine more casual users who do steady-state cardio occasionally will be served just fine by the Charge 5, but that just isn't me. My favorite types of workouts involve HIIT and Interval runs, Peloton's Walk+Run classes, and strength training. For those types of workouts, the Charge 5 was simply an unreliable disaster.\n\nThe first time I did a HIIT run wearing the Charge, I was just confused and frustrated because every time I looked down to check my heart rate (already knowing it had to be peaking because of how I felt) it would be nowhere close to the number I expected. To confirm my suspicion, I started doing workouts wearing the Charge 5 with either the Peloton heart rate monitor or my Apple Watch series 7. After doing some strength classes, and more interval work, I confirmed with data what I had suspected: the Charge 5 can not accurately measure heart rates that change quickly.\n\nThe reading on the Fitbit was always a couple minutes behind where I actually was, or it was just far off from my true heart rate (usually reading much lower--at times around 40 bpm off). I tried changing wrists, adjusting the fit, and even a hard reset. On dog walks the tracking seemed to be much more accurate, but as someone who wants to track actual exercise and not just casual, everyday walks, this doesn't win the Charge 5 any points. If it can't reliably track my heart rate while I do the exercises I love to do, the tracker is useless to me. That means that it's not accurately calculating calories burned, and the data will be useless to me over time to track trends. I like to repeat certain HIIT runs or strength classes to see how I'm improving over time. I can't do that with data from the Charge 5 because the data was reliably incorrect.\n\nI also have a bone to pick with the daily readiness score Fitbit provides. I've been wearing an Oura ring gen 3 for 10 months every day. It knows me well, and I trust its own readiness scores when it comes to accuracy and reliability. For the week plus change that I tested the Charge 5, I had the Fitbit app tell me multiple days in a row that my readiness score was at a 1. Out of 100. Essentially advocating that I stay bedridden to recover. On those same days, my Oura readiness score was in the high 80s, which accurately reflected how I felt and how I trained on those days. The Fitbit was telling me I was exhausted beyond movement, and the Oura was telling me to go ahead full-steam. I listened to the Oura and was absolutely fine. I don't know if the Fitbit daily scores get better over time, but I just don't see how my readiness score could have been so close to the absolute lowest score possible when in reality I felt great. Baffling, and useless considering that eventually it becomes a paid feature.\n\nOverall I'm just so disappointed. I don't understand how these things have a cult-like following. They just aren't accurate trackers. The data is wrong and often. How are you supposed to know how you're improving if you can't look at a workout and trust the data it collected? For me it defeats the entire purpose of a fitness tracker. So I sent it back assuming it was a lemon. But the whole experience was so sour that I won't be coming back for more.",

The moment I attempted to use any other function, the battery drains. To he honest, I have always had to charge it a couple times a day and restart it because it would never retain a charge. Now, after a year and a horrible firmware update that was supposed to fix the battery drain problem, my battery drains FASTER and the Fitbit refuses to charge to 100%. It'll show 100% on the screen but when you restart it, it drops to 96-97%. Thats the highest it will go. From there, it just drops significantly within a few hours. Most of the troubleshooting I've seen Fitbit's support department suggest is to turn everything off (O2 sensor, GPS, display settings, etc.) Essentially, make the Charge a McDonald's kids pedometer.

I have three major complaints:\n\nTerrible Customer Support: The screen on my Charge 5 died. Fitbit Customer Service said I needed to send them a video of the Charge 5 showing the dead screen. Then after I created a video and emailed it, I got no response from Fitbit. I called back and was told that they couldn't view the video I sent because it was too big to be sent as an attachment and was sent as a link to a file on Google. Apparently, Fitbit restricts reps from accessing Google stored files. I was told that the case would be escalated but several days later after hearing nothing from Fitbit, I called back. I was told that I had to send in a video as an email attachment before Fitbit would consider the claim. I was quite upset at that point as I explained the problem. The Fitbit rep threatened to hang up on me because she said I was shouting, even though my language was civil. Still the bottom line with the rep was that I had to send in a video as an attachment before my warranty request would be considered. I made another video, this time only 20 seconds long but the file size still exceeded the 25 MB limit required to be sent as an email attachment. So I downloaded a video editing program, learned how to use it, and was able to reduce the resolution of the 20 second video file so that it was within the 25 MB that could be sent as an email attachment. After all of that trouble, I got an email that my replacement request had been approved and I later received my warranty replacement. One of the worst customer experiences I've ever had with a company.\n\nFrequently the Charge 5 stops connecting to the app. It has gone several days without connecting. The last time after a week of not connecting, I did everything I could think of to get it to reconnect, but it would not connect. I turned Bluetooth off/on, removed/added the device to the app, and tried connecting with my tablet instead of my phone. Nothing worked. It finally reconnected after I uninstalled/reinstalled the app. Right now, as I'm writing this review, I again can't get the Charge 5 to connect to any of my devices, which prompted me to write this review.\n\nFinally, there is the problem with the heart rate accuracy. Sometimes, it is accurate, as I have compared the HR measured by the Charge 5 to a chest strap monitor, but it is frequently much lower than the chest strap monitor. I've found that both Garmin and Polar have more accurate wrist HR monitors than the Charge 5. HR accuracy has always been a problem with the Charge models, and I expected it to improve with the Charge 5 but it has not.\n\nI'm not sure what my next fitness tracker will be but it will certainly not be a Fitbit.",

But I don’t have messages or GPS, etc turned on. Maybe that’s why it’s currently holding a nice charge.\n\nIf you want to take some vitals it’s a manual process not automated.\n\nSo far I like it, but the charging is very hit and miss at least on mine. Even though the magnet connects at the pins as intended it may or may not have a connection. So far I can’t tell if it’s actually charging unless I pop it off the charger.\n\nFor the charger I give that a 3. The rest 4 stars.

I’m mean for goodness sake’s, you can’t even customize the watch face’s color or style save for some “professionally made” designs.\n\nAs for the device itself, my Fitbit desyncs from my phone weekly. In order to utilize my Fitbit, I have to delete it as a device and re-add it. The auto wake function (where the screen turns on by raising your wrist) works about 75% of the time, otherwise I’m tapping the screen furiously to see the time or my pace. I will say the watch itself is comfortable on the wrist and stays charged for days at a time, so no nightly charging, but you can same the same for a AA battery on a string.\n\nIn my opinion, if you don’t want to spend 2x-3x the price on a refined smartwatch/fitness tracker, this will do, but I almost assure you it will end up in the nightstand drawer within a few months.

After that, it took over 3 hours for it to update (and no, the problem is not with my internet). I had hopes for it at first after I finally got it running. However, it continually dropped the connection with my phone, and I had to re-pair them. I tried it on a second phone, and the same problem persisted.\n\nI figured I would give it a legitimate try, but the problems continued. I had it set to battery saving as much as I could; internal GPS and whatnot were all turned off. Fitbit claims it lasts \"up to 7 days.\" I barely got one day out of a full charge. I had the Always On display turned off, set to auto so that I came on briefly when I turned my wrist to look at it. This worked sporadically at best, and that is being generous. I found that I had to shake my wrist to get the thing to turn on. So, that aspect did not work either. I also found that I had to jab my finger at the screen multiple times to get it to wake up. No, it was not it Sleep Mode for this.\n\nI used the Sleep Mode overnight. This seems to have worked pretty well as what it showed me on the app lined up with what I experienced overnight. This is the only good thing I can say about the device.\n\nThe heart rate monitor was completely off. From what it was showing me, I was on the verge of death. I compared it with a Polar chest strap that I trust. The data from the two devices were far apart.\n\nStep counts...... It was counting around ten steps--give or take--for each step I took. I put it on the charger the next morning with around 1500 steps on it. When I came back to it, the device has magically gained another 500 steps while it was sitting idle. It was counting steps while I was on the toilet also.\n\nThe Charge 5 is complete junk. Add all of these problems to Fitbit hiding all the features most people really buy it for behind a paywall. Yes, it's good that you get six months of Premium free, but what after that? If you are not going to have access to and use everything it does, then why pay the $80 per year? It is inaccurate for use even as a very basic step step counter. Don't waste your money on this. I should have heeded the reviews, and now I have to deal with trying to return it.

Fitbit agents told me the they saw no reason to support any other interface then an Android one, go buy one of them... Goggle strikes again\n\nThey are a horrible organization and couldn't give a damn about their customers. My thinking on this is consistent with many other reviews I have read... find another way to spend your money to get what you need.",

I also wanted to use the SmartWake alarm, as I have a lot of issues getting up at a reasonable time and feeling well due to my odd shift schedule. My only complaint is that it's a little clunky to program alarms and such on a tiny touch screen, but I believe that's the same with all smartwatches/trackers. The battery life meets my needs and it charges very quickly (I charge my tracker while I'm in the shower). I also really like the options to change the main display. The built in GPS is a game changer for outdoor runs; I don't have to bring my phone if I don't want to.",

It did this a few times. I would take their sleep measurements with a grain of salt.\nI also like that it is synced with your phone so if you get a phone call or text the watch buzzes, which is very handy if you don't have your phone with you all the time. And super nice to dismiss spam calls on the watch. You can even read your texts that come in. But you can't answer any text or take a call.\nI use the timer and alarm on the watch which are both handy.\nI don't use it to track my exercise or health as I'm already a fairly healthy and trim person, and I'm 61 so I don't work out like I used to.

Several months after purchasing the extended warranty, I received an email indicating my plan had been transferred to the new device owner. Because I still owned the device and it worked great, I suspected someone fraudulently tried transferring the warrant and filing a claim. After calling Allstate’s number, I was told someone in my household likely sold it, and the new owner had indeed filed a claim. I explained I lived alone, still used the device, and had not authorized a transfer of the warranty to another person. Thereafter, Allstate’s representative explained she’d transferred the warranty back into my name and cancelled the claim.\n\nFAST FORWARD…four months later my Fitbit “died”, so I called to file a claim. The Allstate representative told me the plan had been cancelled and the purchase price refunded to me months ago. In response, I explained I had not cancelled the warranty or received a refund. Additionally I asked for proof of payment. Thereafter, the representative placed me on hold, then came and indicated they would send me a check for the purchase price.\n\nFINAL UPDATE…I never received the promised refund.

Fitbit won’t let you add every exercise to the shortcuts from your watch itself.

This also tracks sleeping, which is super valuable to me.

I might be wrong but I've bought a lot of crap from Amazon that does not work or was poorly made.

I travel a lot between two places I call home, so I have to repurchase new spare chargers each time. Between the reduced functionality from previous models and the new charging platform with each release, I am somewhat disappointed with the tracker.\n\nWith respect to the app, it has been generally fine but it presently crashes every time I attempt to apply the firmware update that it indicates my tracker could use. The app crashes after many minutes right as the update is completing. The app is all up to date.\n\nI don't have anything concrete to say about accuracy other than my sense that it is slower to react than my previous model. I have heard many suggest that these wrist trackers are inaccurate, but with my previous model I would often use it alongside a chest monitor and I found it to be very accurate, or at least consistent with my chest monitor. They were often only 1 or 2 beats different. I cannot say the same about the current tracker, but I have far fewer data points so take this with a grain of salt.",

I lost my Apple Watch, and thought maybe I could replace it with a device that offered me a longer battery life in exchange for many features I would not miss (I really don’t need the weather forecast on my wrist).\nSo, here is the great:\nThe battery lasts at least 5 days (I never let it run down all the way, so I do not know the full battery life). This is great. Unlike with my Apple Watch, which needed a charge by the end of every day, I can wear the Fitbit to sleep, and get sleep tracking data. Great. Huge. Very helpful. And this is worth the price of admission.\nThe good:\nIt’s a Fitbit, so naturally it does a great job hunting steps, reminding me to move, etc. As a GPS for recording bike rides, it does an adequate job, although it doesn’t seem quite as accurate as the Apple Watch’s. But whatever.\nThe disappointing:\nUnlike my Apple Watch, it does not have the low-power always-on screen mode, so if I need to tell the time, it needs to sense me wrist twist. It successfully senses the wrist twist about 25% of the time. So, as a conventional time-telling watch, it’s pretty poor. Here’s a small one: like the Apple Watch, if I need to locate my phone, it has the feature to “find” the phone by making it sound. But unlike the Apple Watch’s version, which just works, the Fitbit’s works about a third of the time. Usually it reports that the watch is not nearby, even though it then turns out to be within arms’ length.\nThe annoying: As a matter of policy, it will not send to Strava workouts that do not include GPS data. So, if I workout on the treadmill and with weights, etc, the Fitbit records a workout with heart rate data that I can view as a workout in the Fitbit app, but since there is no GPS data, it will not upload it to Strava. People post indoor workouts, stationary bike rides, etc to Strava all the time. But not with a Fotbit apparently.\nThe confounding:\nAs I understand it, if the Fitbit loses connectivity with my phone during a workout, it will stop logging GPS data for the entire workout?So for example, if I want to run laps and I start the workout near my bag, which has my phone in it, and then during the course of running, unexpectedly go out of range of my bag (who could possibly see that coming?), the Fitbit records the workout without GPS data. This, you guessed it, makes it unwilling to upload this workout to Strava, of course. Sure, makes sense. I guess?\nThe deal-breaker:\nPlaying soccer\nRoad biking\nShowering\nSleeping\nReaching for something in a pants pocket\nCrossing my arms\nLooking at the time\nWhat do all of these activities have in common? All of them have caused the Fitbit to fall off of my wrist. The mechanism that connects the Fitbit to the wrist strap is not ready for public consumption. It is flimsy at best. I am told by my Fitbit-loving friend that this is an anomaly and I should send it back. I will.\n\nThe verdict: This feels like a product that has successfully completed beta testing, but not much more that that.This does not feel like a product mature enough to have a 5 as part of its name.\nI am returning this device and will most likely get a new Apple Watch, and look for a small, unobtrusive companion device for sleep tracking.

OK, so what’s my heart rate? Am I in target zones? Am I approaching my max? I really don’t need to keep track of my steps, as I know I’m covering a lot of ground each day when I’m out with the hounds, and I certainly don’t need to know any of the other functions on the FitBit such as sleep or my hearts electrical activity, in particular as the heart rate function is pretty general.\n\nLet’s just say that the heart rate function hits the broad side of the barn. The interface with my phone and pad work well, and it’s easy to retrieve data from the FitBit app, but there have been times either during more strenuous activity such as long climbs on a mountain bike, or causally walking (everything is up and down here with rarely a level foot placement), where I know the accuracy is off just by taking my pulse, but the FitBit does well when showing general trends. The graphics via the FitBit app are more than adequate.\n\nBottom line, if you want to keep track of your steps and mileage, this product is adequate. For accuracy of one’s heart rate it may keep you in the ballpark. However, if the user wants much more exact data in particular in regard to heart rate, the apparatus falls short.",

My bike says I ride 30-50 miles a day. My fitbit says I go 6-10 miles even if I move my arm(s) to actually see step counts increment. Putting the watch in my pocket does not record any BPM and thus none of the telling “Active Zone” metrics—and the BPMs change hugely depending upon where the device touches my skin. Very frustrating to have to play games for accuracy.\nWhy important? I am 61 and walk 5 miles a day at least as well and want to know if I am staying on target with my ambitious but important goals. I am in the shape of a person half my age and metrics help to motivate me and help me maintain my strict diet. Walking statistics seem more accurate, perhaps due to GPS.\nI also lift weights and use resistance bands an hour a day with great intensity and the fitbit does a poor job of tracking my stenuous workouts—often I see minimal caloric credit or any Active Zone minutes (even when putting watch in appropriate mode).\nIs there any solution by any fitbit or other device to record all physical activities more accurately?",

The one negative, in my view at least, is that the Charge 5 no longer seems to calculate how many stairs / uphill incline steps you take during the day (I found the Charge 4 not only calculated those steps but was also pretty accurate, and I really miss that feature). I do like the new strap (it feels a lot more secure than the one that came with the Charge 4)....

The premium software is ok... I like the sleep metrics (which other trackers also have), I like the 'readiness' score, but the rest of the premium stuff is a waste for me... I am not looking for wellness suggestions, or workout suggestions... I have other sources for those. I do a lot of indoor and outdoor cycling and the Fitbit doesn't seem to deal with those as I'd expect. My bike computer is a smart GPS computer so I don't use the GPS on the Fitbit to track rides (I want to save battery not using on running GPS chip).... but.... it seems to count most pedal revolutions as steps, so the first long ride I did I got a reward badge for walking 13 miles... huh... It counted revolutions as steps and guessed at how far I walked based on steps or time, hence the 13 mile walk badge... double huh... Other rides are similar.. I get step credit, even when entering a cycling mode on the tracker, for riding. It's pretty easy to get 30.000 steps credit for a long bike ride. When I select weight lifting mode for a workout, it tracks calories but I don't have any sense of how accurate that is vs just monitoring heart rate. For the quirks it's a bit expensive, but I would buy it again and would likely buy follow on products when this one dies... probably.",

However, there are 2 items that I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with from a design perspective. The band is NOT like a normal watchband. It has a pin, that fits into the hole pictured on the left and fastens as pictured. The pin pops out frequently. After wearing it for 6 months and popping it in and out, the hole as stretched and it pops out more frequently. It is difficult to get it to fasten tightly enough to get an accurate heart rate reading with out the pin popping out! Seems ridiculous to have to replace a band in 6 months.

        "text": "I occasionally try Fitbit devices, even after past frustrating issues with their software ecosystem. In this case, I was looking for a device to replace my iWatch, in particular the health metric functionality. What I was looking for is a device with good battery life, without all the constant alerts and other funk the iWatch inflicts on its users.\n\nThe Charge 5 looked to fit the bill: inexpensive, provides the health data collection I wanted, had an App to present the data. One downside is the apparent need to sign up for an expensive membership, but I figured I'd give it a year and let the Fitbit ecosystem prove its value.\n\nThe trouble started almost immediately when I unboxed the device and went through the initial setup. Total PTSD, from previous attempts to use Fitbit hardware & software. Here, the device kept failing to perform the initial software update. When I hit the support boards, it was clear that many others had been bitten by this, Fitbit support saying (for 6 months plus) that their team is working the issue, and the usual voodoo medicine Rx from other users about reboot iPhone, reboot Fitbit, delete Bluetooth association, Rekki massage, crystal therapy, accupuncture, and so so. I tried various folk remedies, and after about 1.5 hours of effort got the software update on the device. The morning after, I noticed that the device wasn't presenting Spo2. Cripes! So again, off to support, and the same-old, same-old non remedies. Supposedly Spo2 won't display in some countries (go try to find out which ones), advice about getting timezone, region set properly (the devices does this automatically, so why present that as a problem resolution, Fitbit??). Here again, after some tinkering and praying to the almighty god of tech, Spo2 shows up. Who knows, but if we click out to 30k feet, I ask myself what Fitbit Product Owner, and Product Manager allows a flawed software stack and/or device like this one to ship in the first place. I was this >< close to shipping the thing back to Big Jeff at Amazon, and foreswearing Fitbit for another 5 years.\n\nSo he's the elevator pitch on this device: if you're cool with spending time debugging the stuff the software team *should* have in their test cases, by all means, go for it. The device may work eventually, just sort out the issue before the return window closes. If you expect a more \"Apple\" experience, literally run away from the Fitbit ecosystem, or less dramatically, the Charge 5. I should have done my more thorough diligence before I hit the purchase button, but Amazon has us so spoiled with returns, I regularly seem to shoot my toes off buying things that aren't ready for primetime (like Charge 5) and returning them. I hope Amazon keeps track of this sort of return and brings some pressure to bear on Fitbit.\n\nUpdate: I did end up returning the Charge 5. The Charge 5 wouldn't sync to my iPhone, even when the iPhone was inches away from the Charge 5 on my wrist. I give up. I'll stick with my Apple watch. I hope this was just a bad device, but again looking at the support forums, I see many reports of sync issues. I'd rather be exercising than debugging this thing. Sorry, Fitbit, a big miss here.",

Here is what I have come up with after over 6 months of wearing this item...\n\nIt's good for what it is, but if you are thinking it's a medical device, it's not. Even if you get the free six months of \"Premium,\" it still isn't that amazing, really.\n\nIt does steps and exercise tracking and that's great ... it does keep me motivated and is usually pretty accurate.\n\nWhen it comes to the accuracy of the \"sleep\" portion, it's TOTALLY off. Every day, I have to do in and put when I actually get up in the morning. Sometimes it's as much as an hour off. I have to do this EVERY DAY! So I have no idea how accurate it is in determining when I'm waking up in the night.\n\nStep counter is fine and the mindful thing is ok, I guess. Heart rate monitor makes me wonder sometimes, but it seems fairly accurate.\n\nThe REALLY bad/good news is that after 4 months, it died on me. Totally. The good news is that after contacting the company, they sent me a new one at no charge, but that whole process took about a month. And for it to conk off after over 4 months isn't great.\n\nSo just realize you aren't buying some kind of high powered health monitor and more like a high end step counter with occasional heart rate monitor and sleep analyzer and you should be good.",

        "text": "Let me preface by saying that I’ve owned just about every Fitbit the company has made, dating back to at least 2013–maybe earlier—but I can’t recall.\n\nAnyway, the Charge 5 is perfect for me. I was actually talked into buying an Apple Watch, and for about 2 weeks, my C5 stayed on my nightstand. Then I wore both for several months. Now I’m back to the C5 only. This is mainly about battery life. I can go almost a whole week without charging it, and when I do, I can plug it in while in the car and get a lot of battery in a short period of time.\n\nThis alleviates the need to remove the watch EVERY NIGHT, like the Apple Watch, and leave it on a charger at night and forget it at home when you leave in the morning. Can you tell this has happened to me—multiple times?? And if you’re like me, it’s a serious addiction to keep these fitness trackers on. So forgetting it causes a lot of anxiety.\n\nAlso, I’m not super tech savvy, so I don’t need all the bells and whistles of the Versa, the other high end FB, or the Apple Watch. I can screen my calls, read my texts, and set alarms/reminders. It’s all I need. And I wear it in the shower. I wear it in the pool. It’s been banged up too and it is still going strong. If I decide to use more features, they are there if I need them, which is nice.\n\nNow, only time will tell because I’ve had issues in the past with quality and had to use the warranty with multiple devices. I’ve had the C5 for 6 months maybe. Maybe a year? I can’t remember. But I love that the charger is magnetic and not a clip as almost all the previous FBs are.\n\nOverall, you won’t be disappointed, I promise!",

I've now had the 5 for close to a year and it working properly is hit or miss. The trackers on this model all seem to be questionable on their accuracy (sleeping for 3 hours and it doesn't register but sitting down for an hour shows up as sleep, only registering steps when arm is moving, recording basic functions like walking as x minutes of exercise biking/swimming/etc). A lot of the content requires a premium subscription and there are various features that I would never use but you can't remove them from the watch. This leaves a lot of unnecessary scereens to scroll through when looking for something. The touch screen is a bit slow to respond compared to earlier models and doesn't like to scroll all the way down so a lot of text and buttons are cut off. The text feature is slow, it might take hours to show a text received after I'd already read it on my phone, and hasn't worked at all in probably 6 months.\nRecently the watch will pair to my phone's bluetooth but won't connect to the app long enough to transfer data. Fitbit has apparently been aware of this issue since shortly after release and still haven't found a solution. They give a variety of \"possible fixes\" but most just involve restarting phone/watch/app and are of no real help.

Eventually it stopped working or sinc'ing, so I went through a lengthy tech support session. It came back up but wouldn’t track pulse or sleep, and occasionally won’t show step ‘ladder’ on the clock screen. I went through all the setting multiple times with the support team, and then they requested a video recording of me showing the problems with the fitbit, and displaying the case number, etc. etc., and I have to send it by email. Well, mine ends up being too large of a file to send, and they won’t accept a link to cloud or let you show in on a video call with them.

As with my Fitbit Charge 2, the accuracy of the heart rate is not great, +/- 10 bps compared to a Polar strap, but arguably better than nothing. The display is very bright and much more visible in the sun than the Charge 2 was, although the only clock face that has all the info available is \"Slashed\", which chooses to cut off the bottom of the time digits at an angle. The EKG feature is nice, while it is not as detailed as what the Kardia device produces you can still read it, and you don't need to carry around another gadget. The strap is nice and won't suddenly undo itself leaving your Fitbit on the pavement, but the locking mechanism seems more flimsy and harder to use than the Charge 2 system. Navigation between apps and modes is through both vertical swipes and horizontal swipes from the home screen - not the most intuitive system. Overall it is a great upgrade over the Charge 2 but I took off a star for the faulty battery and strange UI choices made.",

For one, I like all the choices for dial types. I currently use one that shows the day, date, time, zone units, steps and heart rate. With one tap on the unit, you can also see number of calories burned and miles walked. Scrolling down shows more stats, such as steps/hour, selecting a type of work out you're doing, etc. Scrolling through the unit works well and seems to be a little smoother than the Charge 4.

        "stars": "2",
        "text": "Tl;dr The Charge 5 could be great, but fitbit won't allow it and the measurements are very suspect for me.\n\nThe Charge 5 has a lot of potential, however, Fitbit has crippled the device, and the application. For starters, the sensors. The Charge 5 has both an SpO2 sensor and a body temperature sensor. However, the device doesn't make full use of them. You cannot take a real-time SpO2 reading or temperature reading. You can't even access the information in the app or online account. SpO2 is given as high and low averages which isn't helpful at all. You don't have a reference percentage so the averages really don't provide useful information. The same goes for the temp readings. The application only tells you fluctuations in your average temperature, but not what the actual reading is. To top it off, the measurements are only taken when you're asleep which is useless for fitness tracking. The ability to still actual data, and take real-time on-demand measurements would vastly improve the usefulness of the device.\n\nSleep tracking isn't accurate for me. It consistently records time awake as either light sleep or rem sleep. There were a few nights where I was in bed awake, TAKING AN ECG READING OR USING THE FITBIT APP and the following morning the device registered that time as being in either light sleep or deep sleep. If the device can't differentiate between being actively used and the user being asleep it makes a lot of the other sleep readings suspect. There are also times during the night when I've awoken, gotten out of bed for awhile and returned and they're not logged as time being awake. I've tried to adjust the sleep sensitivity and it makes no difference. If I am in bed reading before going to sleep the device will track the inactive period between getting into bed and falling asleep as actually being asleep. To its credit it does show it as being restless sleep, but still inaccurately recorded as being asleep.\n\nThe EDA sensor feature requires the user to pinch the sides of the Charge 5 for 3 minutes in order to take a reading. That's a really long time when you're trying to pinch something that small and hold still. By the end of every scan my fingers and/or wrist were cramped. The device must be worn while scanning so holding it comfortably in your hand isn't an option.\n\nThe mobile application is confusing to navigate. It shows metrics on a dashboard, which may be helpful for some users, but in order to find detailed information you have to dig around for it. The settings are not intuitive and there are an extremely limited amount of options for clock faces, about 24 of them. There is no real app support for the device, only the handful of fitbit branded apps that are available through the app. The fitbit SDK doesn't support the Charge series so creating your own apps or clock faces isn't an option.\n\nThere are a few 3rd party mobile applications (for Android at least, not sure about iPhone) that allow you to collect and analyze your data in much more meaningful ways, but still are not very helpful. To their credit Fitbit does allow users to download their raw data from their account, but in doing so I've noticed that a lot of data is missing. Sleep data is hit or miss, as is heart rate data. This is doing a complete archive export and viewing the json files, so the data should be there, but isn't. I can see it on the app, and in my account dashboard so it exists, but just isn't being provided.\n\nActivity tracking isn't very accurate. I bike to work every day and most days those commutes are not tracked unless I manually tell the device that I'm about to start a biking workout. The minimum length of time that can be set for auto-tracking activities is 10 minutes with the default being 15. If I am pedaling fast, or not slowed down by traffic, my bike commute can be less than 10 minutes. But even when going for a ride in the evening that lasts an hour or more the device doesn't always track that I'm biking. When activities are not tracked it affects the daily readiness score, which looks are previous activities, combined with sleep, to calculate how ready for the day you are. Lacking actual data on activities, and suspect sleep tracking data, the readiness score is rather meaningless.\n\nThis may be an accurate device for some people, but for me it just isn't. The fact that fitbit intentionally cripples devices and makes analyzing your own data incredibly difficult suggests that maybe this isn't the best company to buy a product from if you want to be in control of what you see. That may be fine for some users. I'll be returning the Charge 5 because it doesn't meet my needs and isn't very well supported. Perhaps I'll try the Versa 3 or Sense since they are better supported, but the lack of data analyses tools is a big impediment to taking the devices seriously.",

I’ve branched out in terms of the different exercises that I do and the different things that it tracks, and overall I’m happy with it.\n\nDo I wish it could do some things differently? Sure. As an example, it doesn’t recognize when I work out on my rower As that kind of exercise (although it certainly does track the rise in my heart rate), nor does it connect directly to things like my continuous glucose monitor, the Apple health app (at least not on all channels of data), and more. But I’ll live with that because…\n\n… It has totally changed my sleep hygiene. From the very first day I got it back in December, with rare exceptions, it has been tracking and helping me adjust my sleep. Like many people, I waited way too late in life to understand just how important sleep is. I was one of those “I’ll sleep when I die“ guys. But now, I feel much more in control and much more rested given that I’m sleeping a lot more and making time and room for that in my self-care. That alone is worth the Fitbit premium subscription and the device itself. I even bought one of these for each member of my team, And they’ve all raved about it as well.\n\nI do wish it would recognize my main source of exercise (my Aviron rower - LOVE it) and help keep track of all that, but I haven’t found a solution yet that covers every single option that I’m trying to optimize.

After a few questions, some tests that did not take long at all, the customer care rep authorized the replacement and I received it in the mail in 3 days. What a great customer service. And, Fitbit is a great product. I just felt lost without it the days it did not work and I was waiting for it. It is so good to buy a product that the company stands behind and provides great customer service. Bravo Fitbit!",

        "stars": "4",
        "text": "This is the third Fitbit I've owned. I started with a Fitbit Charge 2, then Charge 3, and now the Charge 5.\n\nPROS: The best thing about the Fitbit Charge 5 is its display. It's the first Fitbit I've owned where the display can be read in even the brightest daylight. I don't care whatsoever that it's a color display. I'm simply happy to be able to use my watch to tell time again outdoors.\n\nThe next best thing about it (and all of the Fitbits) is the mobile app and website. I find these both to be well-designed and intuitive.\n\nWhile other reviewers seem to disagree, I've found most of the basic measurements (steps, heart rate, sleep tracking, and minutes of exercise) seem to be accurate and consistent with other devices I own.\n\nThe ECG seems accurate as well. Though, here I have no other device with which to compare it.\n\nI get about 8 days of battery life. However, this is with GPS disabled (out of privacy concerns).\n\nAll of the above reasons (and mostly the display) are why I've given it four stars.\n\nCONS: First, the four-star rating is based on what matters most to me. A rating that includes things that matter less would drop this device to a three-star or even two-star rating.\n\nThe worst thing about this device is the lack of a physical button (or even a capacitive button) on the side of the watch. Because of this, you are limited to wrist rotation that works most of the time, swipes that often work, and taps that are often unreliable.\n\nAllegedly, the watch is supposed to return to your chosen clock face with two rapid taps. In my experience, this works infrequently. I've literally sat there tapping the watch dozens of times without it doing so. This is far and away the most irritating thing about this watch.\n\nNotifications on this watch are hit or (mostly) miss. About 25% of the time I get a phone call or text the watch correctly notifies me. The other 75% of the time these notifications are lost in the ether :)\n\nThe watch band that it comes with is horrible. Regrettably, the selection of replacement bands is only slightly better. I found one I can live with, but don't like. Also, the latching mechanism for the bands is far less secure than on previous versions of the Fitbit Charge. Even with the factory original band, I have some degree of difficulty getting it to latch. With at least one third-party band, it would not latch AT ALL.\n\nWhen I first received this watch, the ECG feature would not work. It kept requesting I (Bluetooth) pair my device with my phone (which was already done). After an annoying call with Fitbit customer service, I was informed that I needed to wait 72 hours before the ECG would work. I don't mind the 72-hour wait. I do mind that this is not documented anywhere and that the error message says nothing about waiting.\n\nThe EDA scan gives me a number. The number may be accurate. It may not. Since there is no quantitative description of what numbers are good or bad, it seems somewhat useless to me.\n\nThe few clock faces (24) that are available are mostly terrible. They waste the limited real estate available on the face of the watch and distract with ill-chosen, poorly matching colors. Unlike the crisp, clean presentation of the website and mobile app, these clock faces seem designed by a three-year-old, with a short attention span, and a poor sense of color.\n\nIf you've come to rely on the stair counting from previous Fitbit Charge devices, this is gone. With the Charge 2, I previously like this feature. It gave a somewhat accurate count of stairs. With Charge 3, the number was so inaccurate, that it would sometimes register stairs as I walked across a flat room. I'm guessing rather than fix this bug, they decided to simply jettison the feature,\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Overall, I'm comparatively happy with this watch. I desperately wish they would bring back the button on the side (or make the ECG/EDA sensors serve double duty as a capacitive button). Failing that, I hope that a future firmware update fixes the double-tapping gesture so that it actually works. I really hope that Fitbit hires a competent graphics designer for future clock faces. The current crop of faces (with one or two exceptions) is laughably bad. That, and it might be nice if they better documented the newer features (ECG/EDA) instead of leaving their users guessing.",

It counted my eating as steps plus who knows what else. Wore it on the non-dominant hand, both of them at night. Garmin counted 45 steps to the bathroom and back, Fitbit counted 386. What's that about? Rolling over in bed? If I bike outdoors (or in for that matter), and am using the bike exercise feature it logs the biking as steps too. It should be smart enough to figure out that if I am biking I am not taking steps at the same time! The only way to get a reasonably accurate step count is if I keep it in my pocket like I did with my old Fitbit Zip (which I wish was still made as that is all I use this for). Granted there is a significant price differential, but if you want a product that is accurate get a Garmin and skip the Fitbit. The only Fitbit has over Garmin is the app is better. My Garmin tracks my sleep in line with sleep studies I have had, but the Fitbit very different results. They finally got the GPS feature fixed but now it is draining the battery big time and I have to charge it everyday, even when not using that aspect of it. It should know to put the GPS to sleep if you are not doing an exercise activity as there is no way to manually do that, and why would one want to have to remember to turn the GPS feature on and off anyway?

I have been a Fitbit user since the original. The Charge 5 was the best, most accurate. But the reliability is crap!\nI'm also disappointed in Asurion. I purchased their insurance which conveniently issues a fast credit to repurchase. They will not do it if the device is still under factory warranty. So I had to jump through needless hoops on the phone with Google just to have them send me a new device in 7-10 days.

HIIT, spinning, cardio, cardio dance, weight training, yoga, and more. Pretty much anything you can follow along to in a video for exercise, Fitbit has it, so no more searching YouTube for videos, and the Fitbit is smart and measures all your vitals while you workout from a video in the app.\n\nOne of the coolest feature is the auto-recognition of various different types of exercises and the many graphs that it provides both during workouts and for day-long periods on various health data. I’ve been using it for nearly a month and the more data it has, the better and better it gets at calculating things like your metabolism, calories burned, exercise readiness, and other things.\n\nThe sleep feature is really interesting. I don’t know how it works, but every night it generates data and graphs on your sleep, breaking it up into total hours asleep vs awake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. Really interesting!\n\nIn the Premium version there are a lot of pre-made health programs you can shows to participate in that each target a different health behavior. Some are only a week long while others can be many weeks long. They help you form new healthy habits through educational material and prompting.\n\nOverall this is the most useful AI that I’ve ever had. Very much worth the cost!",

There is a water lock which was smart BUT again it’s a HUGE hassle to try and turn it on and off. The heart rate monitor I don’t feel is very good. I’ll be exercising and my heart rate will randomly drop to near my resting rate. Sleep tracking is an absolute joke- I barely slept one night and got up out of bed multiple times and the next morning it labeled that as restlessness and said I got almost 8 hr of sleep but I barely got 5. I absolutely do NOT recommend Fitbit Charge 5.\nI was using my charge 5 until two days ago. I went to charge since it had been about 5-6 days since last charge (which is normal). Took it off the charger at 99% charged. A few hours later it’s completely dead. Try to charge again and dies quickly again. This should still be under warranty but whenever I try to figure out how to make a claim Fitbits website takes me in circles. I messaged Fitbit via Instagram and all they offered was to wait for an update. I get the update and nothing changes for the battery. Message them back and they say wait for another update. At this point the Charge 5 is useless since it can only be worn for at most three hours. Super disappointed that Fitbits have gone from lasting a little over a year (which I was already unhappy about) to well under a year and offer no help to fix their defective products.

I'm amazed at the quality of the output summaries for exercise, sleeping, food tracking, calories, nutrients and macro's tracking which are very good and user friendly. I like the food tracking function for bodyweight maintenance by budgeting calories. The % macros for carbs, fat and protein also show grams of each and are a good tool if you're doing Keto or cutting for bodybuilders. The input to the food data base is user friendly and more than adequate and similar to Fitness Pal but I like the Fitbit better which has all the other functions too in one place. I'm a person who needs accountability and I find myself more disciplined to check my budgeted calories before making food choices. I'm also a personal trainer which started from my own 140 lbs weight loss journey about 20 years ago so I'm familiar with most all the programs and gimmicks for monitoring exercise and food progress.

That feature is accurate. The pulse readings are accurate and agree with my cuff readings. The Specific Oxygen reading is accurate and that's useful to this 80 year old ex smoker. Occasionally the steps count is low by about 10% but mostly it's accurate. That's good enough for my needs. There's a small learning curve to navigating because there's no button but I'm very comfortable navigating the screen now that I've used it a little. I use my Fitbit to monitor my heart and my activity. The Charge 5 gives me a little more info than my Charge 2 and the accuracy is close enough. The one thing I would change is the band. I prefer a traditional buckle but this band works fine and I won't deduct a star just because I prefer something that doesn't come with the tracker. I did not sign up for Premium because I no longer do intense workouts so I don't need those features. Hope this helps.",

        "text": "The Fitbit Charge5 offers a host of body measurements to help you keep healthy, but many are experimental or poorly measured, leaving considerable doubt about their utility. In some ways this “watch” is a step backward, as my 20-year-old Casio shows me the time (date and elevation) continuously (no need to tap the Casio to see the display), is easily read in bright sunlight (good luck with the Fitbit), is waterproof, and it never needs charging.\nWhat the Fitbit adds is motion detection (it counts the swinging of your arms as you walk and calls them “steps”) and heartbeat rate (measured optically from the periodic widening of your arteries). Walking is really good for you, especially as you age, as it maintains bone density and promotes blood flow and healing. Couch potatoes impair their health, especially over the long run; the Fitbit might motivate you to keep moving to keep healthy. The main flaw in this device is that it treats almost any arm motion as equivalent to walking. I get hundreds or even thousands of “steps” from arm motions when I’m not walking; for example, grating cheese, or varnishing boards. Driving on some dirt roads are often credited as “steps”. In aggregate, my Charge5 has awarded me 15,000 “steps” in a single day for activities that I did without shaking a leg.\nBut what really sticks in my craw is the Fitbit’s misreading of heartbeats. How do I know that it is a misreading? After all, I can easily see the number of steps I take in a day, but heartbeats are not so readily counted. I set the Charge5’s screen to one of the choices that allows me to see the heartbeat rate anytime I turn the screen on; then over many weeks I repeatedly bicycled two 5+ mile rides, one on pavement and the other a gravel road. Both include 10% grades, uphill and down, and I took note of the reported heartbeat rate. Much of the time the graphs shown in the Fitbit app corresponded to what I observed throughout the ride, but occasionally the graphs were wildly in error. I reported the problem to Fitbit and they unhesitating gave me a new watch, but the new watch makes the same mistakes. I conclude that their sensors are just not up to the task.\nFitbit groups heartbeat rates into four classes, which correspond closely with my physical exertions: 1) resting, 2) active but not breathing hard (e.g. walking on the flats: Fitbit calls this “fat burning”), 3) breathing vigorously (pedaling steeply uphill; Fitbit calls it the “cardio” zone), and 4) gasping for breath (working harder than my body can sustain: “peak”). “Fat-burning” is mildly beneficial for cardiac conditioning and therefore Fitbit awards 1 “zone-minute” for each actual minute spent with a heartbeat that is 40-59% of the way from one’s personal minimum (measured from your resting rate) to one’s personal maximum (calculated from your age). “Cardio” is the zone above that, 60-84% of the way from your personal minimum to your personal maximum, and peak is the zone above 84%. The Charge5 awards you 2 “zone-minutes” for each minute you spend above 60%, but it notes that time spent above 84% can be damaging to your body and therefore should be entered only occasionally. For example, from hundreds of measurements of my heartrate I know that at the top of 10% grades on my bicycle, I sometimes enter the “peak” (=>84%) zone, but as the incline eases off I rapidly return to the unequivocally beneficial “cardio” zone. The core function of the Charge5 is the game of accumulating zone-minutes through vigorous activity. The watch has innumerable cheery messages that it sends you whenever you are accumulating zone-minutes, and it gently chides you every hour that you fail to do so.\nHere are some examples of how badly the Charge5 measures heartrate. I was driving through a calm residential neighborhood to go bicycling, parked, strapped on my Charge5, and stepped out of the car, when the Fitbit congratulated me on earning cardio zone-minutes (in reality, I would not have yet even entered fat-burning). On my daily 30 minute ride on gravel, my Fitbit once calculated that I averaged 150 beats per minute (BPM) over the entire 30 minutes, when experience with that exact ride shows that I only occasionally exceed 120 bpm for a minute or two. For my age, 150 bpm is considered the maximum heartrate I can achieve; to sustain that for 30 minutes would presumably kill me. I have personally never seen a credible instantaneous measurement of >135 bpm. I could push that hard, but I would be gasping for air, and I’m too old for that for any length of time. To average >150 bpm for 30 min is simply unimaginable. Almost every night, one of the two bpm graphs (the zone-minutes graph) shows me reaching cardio (and sometimes peak) when I am sound asleep.\nI mentioned before that the Fitbit misreads arm motions as steps, but it also misreads arm motions as heartbeats. My Charge5 has repeatedly attributed cheese grating or painting as zone-minutes in the cardio or even “peak” ranges, when in reality I did not have even mildly elevated breathing.\nOne infuriating example of misreading heart beats is to be found in the discrepancies between the two heartbeat graphs found in the Fitbit app. One is located under the zone-minutes sub-screen; the other under the heartbeat sub-screen. Both purport to show your heartbeat rate throughout the day, and the curves are mostly similar, but the numbers do not agree. I frequently see one graph (the zone-minutes one) that is 40 bpm higher than the other. Unfortunately, the errors are not consistent; I think it depends on the frequency of the arm jiggling that seems to produce the errors. Sometimes the bumps on a washboard gravel road is just the right frequency and the heartbeat rate is error-free; at other times the reported heartbeat is up to double the actual elevation above resting bpm.\nNote that all of the errors inflate the number of zone-minutes earned by a particular activity. Perhaps Fitbit finds these errors tolerable because users enjoy the flattery.\nBased on my experience, I have the following recommendations to avoid erroneous heartrate measurements. If you are doing an activity regularly, exercise while observing the instantaneous heartbeat rate, and note the typical value for each part of the activity, and then ignore the daily graphs that are wildly different. Do not use the GPS tracking feature unless you really need it; use of the GPS precludes you from seeing instantaneous measurements, and every time I use the GPS I get some huge errors. Be skeptical of any measurements taken from a gravel or rough road; four-wheeling produces a lot of bogus steps and heartbeats. Wear a long-sleeved shirt over your Charge5, as it will dampen jiggles that produce bogus heartbeats. Wear your Charge5 only on your non-dominant hand (left for right-handers). If there is a discrepancy between the two graphs in the Fitbit app, defer to the lower values (usually on heartrate sub-screen).\nWith those caveats, the Charge5 has some useful measurements: the sleeping temperature feature is purported to be diagnostic for detecting long-covid, for example (though you need a long string of measurements prior to and after getting covid). And it you cherish a dog that loves you because you feed it, you may find solace in the Charge5’s regular messages of encouragement for each time you earn a zone-minute. If you care about the accuracy of those zone-minute measurements, you might want to consider another choice.",

I wanted something a little thinner and it SEEMED to me that this charge 5 had all the same important features I liked as my last versa so I pulled the trigger. Less than a month later I am returning it, bought the Versa 3 instead. Here's why:\n- Touch is non responsive, a LOT. Annoyingly so... I'll be swiping and nothing will happen...or I will tap it to wake the screen up and nothing happens.\n- The \"exercise\" options are very limited. There's no \"workout\" option so if what I was doing didn't fall under basic things like \"Run, weights, swimming, treadmill\", I had to choose what I thought was the closest or most accurate, which in reality is NONE of the above.\n- This one may be minor, but dismissing an alarm was annoying. I have several alarms a day, whether it be to wake up, to take my meds, to take my vitamins, follow up reminders to do those things... you get it. The Versa you just do a simple swipe to dismiss the alarm whereas on this one you have to swipe AND tap and half the time the tap does not register so your wrist just keeps vibrating. ANNOYING.\n\nJust spend the little bit extra and get the Versa 3.",

I was furious as this was one of the features I was most excited about, and the last thing I want for stress mgmt is staring at my phone\n- band that it comes with causes moisture build up, not breathable\n- ECG usage is underwhelming, also requires phone and doesn’t work half the time - also what value am I really getting from this??\n- auto-display turn on from me pulling my wrist up, a great feature, is horrible now - I have to snap my wrist with a lot of force for it to work\n- the navigation on device is…tedious…doesn’t feel intuitive and swiping is tough with such a small screen, and cannot even see where I am as my finger is covering the screen. would prefer analog button to cycle through\n- vibrating alarm does not stop when I dismiss, continues for another second or two - this is weirdly infuriating, I find myself thinking GET THIS THING OFF MY WRIST if I am in the middle of something and it goes off.\n\nOverall I’m a bit disappointed - great tech jammed into a great design, but poor user experience and lack of expected features bummed me out.\n\nJust to say it one more time for emphasis - WTF bring back breathing app!!!!

        "text": "FINAL UPDATE May 30, 2023 - Well today the screen went dark on my Charge 5. Again followed all the trouble shooting steps. It collects data and syncs with the app, but the screen doesn’t display (faintly shows fitbit logo on re-boot) so it’s useless without pulling out my phone and launching the app. Meanwhile, a family member has had a similar Garmin tracker since 2016 and it has always worked and holds the same charge since purchase.\n\nTime to move on from this junk bit.\n\nUPDATE 3-Sept-22 After multiple follow up emails with no response I again used the chat feature in the app. They went through all the same questions as they have each time to see if I did all the potential resolutions (which are all listed on their site too). I answered every question and FINALLY…FINALLY they agreed to send me a new FitBit. None of the below has changed but the company FINALLY did right by the customer.\nUpdate 23-Aug-22 the recent “update” has not resolved the issue. The device will show 1% when plugged in but then turns off. It’s impossible to run the update when the device won’t turn on nor charge.\n\nAfter years of being a Fitbit customer I can no longer recommend them due to random failures, lengthy wait times for updates, and dead devices with support that matches.\n\nI want to like this device, but Google has destroyed FitBit. With past products the service was helpful, even sending out a replacement device at no cost.\n\nYet the 5 has been a lesser than experience from the start. The fitbit app has been unchanged for years. You can pay more to get more, but the value of what you get isn’t worth it to the general population.\n\nThe new style band is clever but will rub you raw. Adjusting it so it doesn’t rub makes it too loose to operate. So either wearing and deal with the sore spots and peeling skin or leave it off until you want to use it for a specific purpose. Yet that sort of defeats the purpose of being able to track your daily activity.\n\nFinally, a month ago my Fitbit started draining from fully charged to dead in less than 12hrs. Reaching out to support got a “we’re working on it” response. I’ve followed up asking for updates, replacement device, etc and only hear back with things like, “we’re aware of the issue” “a new update is being released”.\n\nIn the meantime, I don’t bother wearing it. It drains dead in hours, is finicky about charging, and both the app and firmware say up to date even though one of their responses provides the new firmware version except you can’t get it yet.\n\nA month of being down and terrible customer service with no proactive follow up. This fit bit isn’t worth it.",

When I bought the Charge 5, I thought I was just upgrading to the next generation. Boy was I wrong! The Charge 5 cannot get wet! If it does, you are supposed to dry it off immediately. Well, this is a basic problem since I sweat profusely when I am working or when it’s hot. My Fitbit lasted about 2 1/2 months before the display stopped working. The company was very nice and replaced it under the warranty. But it is only a matter of time before sweat takes this one out; then I will be out of luck! No more Charge 5 for me!",

Yes, there is a water lock button you can activate, but it shouldn't really be necessary.\n\nWhat's worse is that even though the display is super sensitive to water, it's not very sensitive to the double tap feature required to use some of the menus. It's very annoying. I find myself double, quadruple, sextuple tapping all over, frustrated.\n\nThe \"improved\" color display is tacky as hell. Just ugly.

Not a single classy, simple theme with just black and white and information.\n\nWhy is it so hard to show me the time, the date (and day), and a FEW statistics (steps, distance, calories, etc.). There is plenty of screen real estate to display information, but they opt for ugly colors, bad layouts, and frustrating UX where I have to repeatedly click to get the info I want.\n\nThe worst part is the band. The Charge 4 band was comfortable and easy to take on and off. This thing is a hot sweaty, itchy mess which doesn't even fit well. The small band is too small and the large band is too large. The Charge 4 I had a couple settings with the large band which were both comfortable, one a little tighter and one a little looser. This one, loose or tight, all uncomfortable.

So Jan 7, 2022, I purchased a FitBit Charge 5. I began to notice burn marks on my wrist. I changed wrists. I continue to get burn marks. I contacted FitBit via Facebook – I've gotten nothing but run around. They suggested I use better hygiene (WTH?!), I provided the dates of purchase, they had the date I contacted them, but then kept saying they needed a date it began before they could open a help ticket. I first contacted them in April and it's now almost July with no resolve. I don't leave a lot of negative reviews, but when I product causes bodily harm just after purchase and the company gives that kind of run-around with no resolution, I thought others should know. I don't think burn marks are healthy for the skin (one of our biggest organs that absorbs whatever it exposed to).\n\nI love the idea of having a fitness tracker, but this has been beyond disappointing and troubling that a fitness company could have such a low regard for health = (\n\nUPDATE: Today is 10-12-2022; my last email reply from FitBit was on Aug 9, 2022; it was another generic email that read:\n\n\"Thank you for getting back to us.\nWe appreciate your feedback related to this process.\nNote that at this time, all the instructions are needed to complete it, rest assured we are doing our best to help you with it.\nWe appreciate your patience and if you have other questions let us know.\nSincerely,\nDanny X. and the Fitbit Team\"\n\nAnd as of Oct 12, 2022, still NO REPLY OR HELP! I checked FitBit on BBB; they have a D- rating. It's actually sickening that a health oriented company has ZERO concern for the health of their customers! Even when you contact their Exec VP, they give ZERO help. How does a poorly managed company like this stay in business?",

Additionally for biking, it somehow managed to drop gps for 30 miles straight on a ride. So while it was supposedly tracking my ride, it apparently couldnt get a signal for 2 hours....\n\nSo in summary, this watch is a complete waste of money if you want it for any sort of GPS capability.

However, this device's main downfall is that there's no room for the device to grow due to a severe lack of app support. You get the 8 apps that come on the device and THAT'S IT. There's also limited customization regarding what information pops up on the watch faces, and you aren't able to re-order the widgets. So the TIMER widget for example, you have to either swipe 4 times to the left or 3 times to the right to get to the timer. The only way to get to the timer quicker is to pick widgets you won't use much and delete them from the watch entirely. I wish there was more customization, but what they DO give you works well and looks good. Device is good enough for me to continue wearing but secretly I'll be looking forward to the next generation.",

I cannot comment on the accuracy, except for the exercise monitor. It was excellent for distance and heart rate.

I was not going to abandon one investment and acquire another, even at a discount. The replacement won’t charge at all - I received only the unit, no cable and no wrist band.

        "text": "At the time of this writing, the Charge 5 is selling for $128. This watch is worth about $30, honestly. Half the features are tied into their \"premium\" service which is $10 a month. The hyped up readiness feature doesn't work. I got 4.5 hours of sleep last night and it rated me at a 90. Ok then. The phone app lacks common sense. Why is it so hard to find out how much battery life the device has? In the app it shows up for a moment when you put the device on charge. Then it goes away and you have to go into settings to find, which takes quite a bit of navigating to get to. The reason is because the battery sucks. It has to be charged at least once a day if you use the always on feature. My Charge is less than a month old with just about everything turned off. It shouldn't need to be charged that often if the company is advertising the always on feature as something they expect the average user to have on. From review videos on YouTube, most tests show it's sensors to be accurate. That's great if you plan to use it as a pedometer or heart rate monitor or if you can figure out how to use the \"wake during light sleep mode,\" which I can't, even after turning that feature on in settings. It also does not have GPS on the device. It's in the app and it's only for tracking your path if you have it on during a hike or jog. I like the look of it. I can't be any less impressed with it's functionality. I wish I'd have gotten a smart watch that may be slightly less accurate than a Charge 5. When my \"premium\" plan runs out in 5 months, I'll probably move on to a smart watch.",

The support person said the Charge 5 was the closest to it so I bought it from Amazon. I use it as my alarm clock and couldn't wait for it to arrive from them, Amazon got it to me the next day.\n\nFirst problem was trying to set it up. During the setup we had to do a reset twice and were chatting with support for over two hours. Never need them for set-up except for when I got the Charge 3 and gave the previous model to my husband.\n\nThis device has more things than I need. I can't take them off the Fitbit, so I have scroll through them all the time. Not a big deal, but annoying to waste battery and time to scroll through things I don't want.\n\nThe real issue is that since the initial setup on April 19th, I keep losing the alarms. I've deleted them, I've done resets/restarts/updates, but it keeps happening. Sadly, this morning was the last straw, but my window to return the device was last month. I should have gone with my gut and sent it back the first week, but I was hoping it was just my learning curve. Instead, what I'm seeing now is that this is a known issue with many different ways of trying to fix. The problem is that you don't know if it is actually fixed until all of the sudden, it isn't. Last night, my 8:00 alarm went off. This morning, the 3:00am and 3:05 alarms did not. Yet, when I look at the alarms, they appear to be set fine.\n\nThe photo was to show the tech another problem that happens once in a while (keep in mind I've had this for less than 8 weeks). Sometimes it gets stuck in a partial swipe. The time is still accurate, but it is locked. You can see the \"0\" is cut in half. The only way to fix it is to turn it off and on.\n\nAs much as I've loved the previous Fitbit models I've had, I LOATHE this one. I actually bought a 3 year warranty for this one and I am not going to make it 3 months. I've decided I'm either going to get a Charge 3 from Walmart or I'm getting an Apple watch. I'm done with this thing. Biggest waste of $175 (including the warranty) ever.",

I bought a cheap $40 tracker around the same time, which functions far better than the Charge 5 and holds a charge over several days.\n\nThis is seriously lame, Fitbit !! VERY disappointing.\n\n—————\nI’ve had this thing less than a month and am really disappointed. I used to have a much cheaper Flex that was much simpler and worked better than this Charge 5.\n\nWhile I try to wear it daily, I’m not doing anything ongoing active. (I bought it for next month when I’m on surgery recovery and want to get on a daily exercise kick.)\n\nBarely two weeks in, it wont hold a charge past two days.\n\nWhether on dominant hand or non-dominant, the step accuracy is questionable. The sleep monitor is definitely questionable; sometimes it give good details of movements, and other times, it barely notices any change, when I KNOW I’ve had a lot of movement.\n\nThe app itself is ridiculously complicated, especially when its Premium advertisement and “helpful tips” keep shoving themselves at you, even when you try to turn them off. Why do you have to hop two screens just to see the gizmo’s battery status?\n\nAnd just my luck, being more than two weeks agone, I’ve already thrown the box away, so I doubt I can return it. 🤬🤬",

I'll just be sitting at my desk and it will fall off.\n\n3. Battery life if awful it might last a day, still have 90% battery and then die overnight.

Support - they will not listen, just go through their script and ask you to disable the features one by one to try to eke some battery life out of the thing.\n\n5. Fitbit's chat app is not usable on an android phone. It zooms in so far you can't see anything you're typing.\n\n6. Sleep tracking is useless. It fell off my arm in the middle of the night but said I slept until I retrieved it an hour or so after I'd gotten up.\n\nThe main reason I bought it was a brighter display - and it is brighter I can see it clearly in full sun... unless it has fallen off again.

I care most about the heart rate monitor and the GPS feature to track pace and distance. HR monitor has to sit just right on your wrist, but works well when it does. The most critical feature though is GPS. This works about 20% of the time for me, and the rest of the time it's trying to connect. So on a five mile run, it seems to be guessing about location, and thus pace and distance, for most of the work out. Really does NOT give me confidence about the accuracy, especially when my boyfriend's phone based tracker gives different distances that add up to a 30 second per mile pace difference. If you just want it as a step counter and food diary, you'll have few complaints though. It is great for that. Just might not be worth the price for folks who want more than that.",

I had no problems with the return when I explained what was happening and that I tried all the troubleshooting.\nThe GOOD: Nice looking, sleek design, smooth, soft band, able to see the watch face in sunlight, waterproof. The BAD: Had to beat the crap out of the screen, tried side of the screen to come on. I tried a light touch, hard touch, it just sucked. It just took so much effort. Flicking my wrist seemed to be the only way it came on every time on cue, I saw tendonitis in my future from the constant flicking. I missed pushing a button and seeing the time. I did try the manual and auto, they both sucked. I could not imagine putting a screen protector on it, as the screen just didn’t respond for me without one. I read that people with protectors said their charger didn’t work. Not sure that’s true, but I thought I’d throw that in for you to research. I also did not like any of the watch faces. They all looked so abstract and crazy. I just wanted big black and white lettering, and not an art showcase. I will say the screen in the light is way better to see then the Charge 2, that I loved. There is no way to arrange what order comes up on your screen like on the Charge 2. So, I must swipe through notifications, which I don’t use to finally get to my exercise. The treadmill did not log for me, but it would in run mode on a treadmill. Amazon rep said it doesn’t log treadmill runs. Not sure its true, but there is an exercise listed for treadmill. I also didn’t see aerobics as an option, just workout. I can’t see well without my glasses, and I don’t run in my glasses. With my Charge 2, I just started my run and at the end, held the side button to feel the vibration to let me know I ended the run. The Charge 5, you must tap the screen to start, then pause, then done and then finish. What??? Three steps to end my run when I can’t see the screen. The OEM band was nice and smooth, but I could not get the right tension. I have a small wrist and on one hole I was too tight and the other too loose, so I didn’t feel it was super comfortable. I was hoping it may stretch because the band is smooth and soft. I wish someone made that soft, smooth band material for the Charge 2 but with the buckle. I like the smooth, non-buckle band but it just didn’t fit me. Also, none of your bands, screen savers or chargers from the 2, will transition to the Charge 5. I did the 6-month free premium trial and none of the extra sleep, heart and Oxygen sensor would work. It also would not log my sleep from day one. It doesn’t count stairs anymore, but I didn’t use that much anyway, but I know people who do. In the run it buzzes you when you’re in-cardio mode and in fat burning mode, but never lets you know when your out of it. I didn’t find it useful. Plus, by the time I looked at the screen it shut off even though I had the screen display set to long time. I just felt for a brand-new tracker, it should not have had so many problems out of the gate, even trying all the troubleshooting, reading blogs from similar people who had the same problems. I looked at getting the Charge 4, most people said the Spotify was worthless. I guess if you want the 4 or the 5, it would be for the GPS and payment feature, which didn’t hit any of my needs. I have my phone on an armband and listen to music from my phone, so the GPS worked on my Charge 2 fine. I am sure there are killer features for runners on the new Fitbit. But I just wanted a simple tracker for exercise, steps, stopwatch, and time. I just think that it wasn’t that great for what my needs were. I bought a new Charge 2 on eBay. If I could not have found a new Charge 2, I still would have returned the Charge 5 and bought another brand. There were just too many annoyances for me to deal with on something I wear 24/7.",

The battery life has been inconsistent and generally poor for most of that time. I checked the Fitbit website Community forums and followed the recommendations, which is basically turn off all the functions that make the device appealing. This has helped a bit, but not for long. Over the past few days, I have fully charged the device and it has died on my wrist the next day. I also restart the device after every time I charge, which was also recommended in the forum on their website. The live chat support feature on the website was easy to use and the staff person friendly. However, there wasn't much support offered. She told me to do everything I had already done. She then said a firmware fix is in development and to hold tight till that is released. This fix has also been mentioned in the forums. It seems Fitbit has been aware of the issue almost since the Charge 5 was released and been working on the firmware fix ever since. There is no timeline for its release.",

My Charge 3 actually still works great, but I wanted to upgrade for the ECG feature and because I have trouble seeing the Charge 3 and Charge 4 outside in bright sunlight.\n\nPros\n- All the same features\n- ECG seems fairly accurate. I know I get flutters sometimes due to a health condition and so I've been able to track it with the ECG feature\n- I can actually see this outside in the daylight!\n- I like that the charger is a lot easier to get it properly attached to the terminals than on the prior models.\n\nCons\n- I am nervous about even possibly getting this thing wet. the latch on this seems very inferior to the Charge 3 and Charge 4. It is quite touchy and easy to get it stuck. I'm not keen on exposing it to anything or even changing out bands often because of this. The Charge 3 and Charge 4 will take a bit more rugged use. Honestly, this is probably the biggest downfall for me. I'm concerned about the longevity.,\n- This is more of a fitbit app issue. Finding the ECG readings is a multistep process and they were sort of difficult to find at first\n- The ECG service has to be paid for, which I already knew in advance\n- There is a passive Afib detector that you can agree to activate that will detect Afib outside of using the ECG app. I had an episode yesterday that I caught the tail end of it with the app. The passive Afib detector never triggered.",

My first one was the original \"Charge\".)\n\nA main attraction for me is the Charge 5's ability to take an ECG reading, so I was a bit disappointed when that seemed to be the only feature that didn't work. After a lengthy tech support call, some uninstalls and restarts, we got ECG working. Assuming everything is smooth sailing from this point on, I think this is going to be a great device. (I'm keeping my fingers crossed.)\n\nMy experience with FitBit's tech support was excellent. I used their online chat, and they walked me through troubleshooting the ECG issue. After reinstalling both the FitBit phone app (Android, in my case) and the ECG app on the FitBit device and then relinking them, everything is now working great.\n\nI didn't purchase the \"Premium\" subscription.

This model is a real decline from the previous models we've had (Charge 4 and Charge 3.)\n\nThis one was unreliable from the start. All controls are managed through the touch screen and the touch screen often does not respond. You might need to tap 2-5 times just to find out what time it is.\n\nThe battery life is extremely erratic. Sometimes it lasts for 5 days, sometimes half a day, with the same level of activity.\n\nIn the past week, it started freezing up regularly until today when it stopped functioning altogether. Even a hard restart won't bring it back from the dead. We've been a Fitbit family until now but I'm not sure we'll ever try another one after this experience.",

        "text": "I've been using the Charge 5 for over a week now. 1st - The heart rate monitor appears accurate as I've compared the readings to what I get with my Garmin and an arm sensor I use for cycling. The Fitbit was within 1 or 2 beats of the Garmin, either up/down, at all times. 2nd - The sleep monitor appears to be accurate along with the associated respiration and O2 levels. While I don't have a separate monitor for these parameters, they are consistent night to night so would be a good indicator of any drastic changes either good or bad. 3rd - The distance as measured by the GPS is within the margin of error as compared to my Garmin. Even individual Garmins measure slightly different distances over the same route from one ride to the next. That's just the nature of GPS as provided for civilian use.\n\nNow, for the band design. I will guarantee I'll lose this thing at some point in the future. The attachment of the band to the unit itself works well if the tension is perpendicular to the attachment point. However, if any sideways/parallel torque is applied, the band easily comes away from the actual unit. This torque can come from something as simple as the sleeve of my base layer catching on the band.\n\nExcept for the band issue, I would have given the Charge 5 a 5 star rating. But, the fact that I WILL lose it at some point, I can only give it 3 stars.",

Great form factor, thin, light, great screen, comfortable band, superb online web/phone app connections points for off-loading data. What's not to like?!?\n\nUnfortunately, the thing I couldn't get past is that the heartbeat monitor - i.e., the primary function for which I wanted a fitness tracker - was disturbingly unreliable. I tested it against other sources of reliable HB activity monitoring, including just a stopwatch and my finger on the pulse, and it was frequently far off for more than a few moments.\n\nI tried tightening the band, didn't really address the issue (while making it less comfortable.\n\nI noticed that while outdoors walking, if I put my other hand over my wrist (shielding the unit from the sunlight) it would work better - until I removed my shielding hand when it would go off again. Apparently the thinline design leaves very little overlapping watch surface to shield the optical HR readers from extraneous sunlight.\n\nThe problem was not as pronounced indoors as it was outdoors in the daylight. This makes me believe that the benefits of a thin watch body come at the cost of a compromised HR accuracy when outdoors.\n\nWell, for me, that's a show stopper. If I can't rely on the HR monitor feature unless I'm indoors, I've compromised a key use case that prompts me to want to buy a fitness tracker in the first place.\n\nYMMV. Happy hunting for a device that meets your needs. I really wanted this to meet mine but as explained above it did not do so.",

Plus it charges fast, a 10-20 minute charge-up will get you through the day.\n-Great fitness and sleep tracking with outstanding app: one of the reasons I bought a 2nd fitbit is because I love the app, simple and practical. Generates a cool report with your ECG waveforms...impressive!\n-Messaging working great: the Versa 2 was hit or miss with messaging, the C5 is 100%, I get a quick summary of all my texts and emails, with enough information to know if I have to pull out my phone or not.\n-Alarm is great! For some reason I love waking up with the little buzz on my wrist, audible alarms put me in a bad mood when I wake up.\n\nCons:\n-NO WEATHER APP: I almost returned the watch because of this, one of my favorite features on the Versa 2 was the weather app. Come on fibit, you can do, I would probably pay $10 if they let me by the app separately.\n\nI would of loved to get something like the Galaxy Watch 4, but with all it's battery limitations, it would just stress me out too much. Fitbit really got it right with the battery life and the app, I hope they add flexibility in the apps section on the C5. I guess I could have went up to the Versa 3 or Sense for the apps, but I just got so bored of that rectangular form factor, if they had a round shaped version I would have got it.",

        "text": "I've been a big fan of Fitbit for years. I've owned the Charge, Charge 2, Versa and decided to get the Charge 5 because I wanted a durable, moderately-priced fitness tracker to tote around for activities like playing softball, swimming, camping, etc. because the battery life is just so good compared to almost all other trackers. The Charge 5 has a great battery life and built-in GPS and can still run 4+ days in my testing with GPS on the tracker itself. Impressive! It's also fairly light and while the stock band isn't as comfortable as I'd prefer, it's good.\n\nThat being said, I have a major gripe: the heart rate tracker. It's accurate but, and there's a major BUT, it's extremely laggy and doesn't engage with activities unless your fitness tracker catches an extreme jump in HR. Extreme = 40-50 BPMs higher than average HR. There's a chance that the tracker is actually grabbing the correct HR data but it's not displaying it. I own an Apple Watch series 6 44mm and the HR tracker on that thing is snappy. When I am not manually pushing the activity mode to track activity, the HR tracker can take 30-60 seconds in many cases to catch up. Eventually it locks in and is in lock-step with my Apple Watch (I've tested both on opposing wrists simultaneously) so I know the HR tracker is accurate but the lagging indicators are a concern for overall accuracy. Historically, Fitbit has also been a little exaggerated with total calories burned too but I can't determine how accurate/inaccurate this Fitbit is.\n\nOne of my favorite things between the Fitbit and Apple Watch is the total calories burned tracker versus \"activity tracker\" on the Apple Watch because the activity tracker doesn't do the best job catching low-intensity activity (standing, slow walking) so if I stand at my desk for 5+ hours at work I'm not really tracking the total benefit of that and it makes it hard to gauge where I'm at for the day. If Apple changes this and the Apple Watch becomes even more durable AND can run 2 days with activity tracking I'll probably stop using the Fitbit line. I had faith Google would improve the quality even more and the software would be fantastic. There's a couple small improvements but it's not really a legitimate step forward.\n\nIn all honesty, a GPS isn't all that useful to many people when they're using the device with their phone which can GPS track passively. Google should do better with the Fitbit Charge. Maybe they will but while this is a good device it's not the greatest and hard to justify the price versus just buying a less-expensive Charge 3 or 4 which is about as accurate.",

The 'double tap' does not work at all points.\n- To repeat the above, the touch screen is not very reliable.\n- The charger sucks. The Charge 4 had a nice clip-in feature that held the tracker while it charged, but the Charge 5 has a magnetic thing with a magnet that is far too weak. Half the time the electrodes don't want to line up, you have to delicately get it just perfect to get it to charge.\n- There is no way to turn off all vibration. I don't want distraction, but there are some uncontrollable alerts.\n- The number of buttons you have to click to start and especially end an exercise is really annoying. Doubly so since, again, the touch screen isn't very reliable.\n- There is no way to turn off things on the screen that you didn't put there: goal celebrations, 'Start run?', etc. I want to look at my watch and see the time, but sometimes I can't and I either have to wait or to exit a screen, which might not be safe while I'm biking or running. Especially since the touch screen sucks.\n- The ECG is really hard to get to work.\n- 90% of the time it doesn't autodetect biking.",

I was not using the GPS or exercise tracking, I dimmed the screen, I turned off call notifications, I did not have the screen on all of the time, and I did not activate the Premium service (thank goodness!!). I did all of the things recommended for improving battery life to no avail. What good is a tracker when you cannot use most of the functions without draining the battery in less than half of the time advertised? I guess this one will be returned, and it will be an Apple watch for me. Buyer beware!!",

These are the devices I've purchased and used over the years:\n\nCharge HR - if you didn't sync the device for an extended period (7 days) it would lock up and refused to sync data over to the app (I suspect it was timing out on too much data to send)\n2nd Charge HR - If you had thought the first one was a fluke the same problem was on the second one too.\nInspire 2 - Worked great for 1 year and 1 month and I let it run out of power after 8 days cause I lost my charge cable. After finally recharging the device, it refused to turn the screen back on. No hard reset or changing clocks made any difference and it was 1 month out of warranty, so Fitbit didn't do anything except offer me a discount on a new device, which I hadn't planned on having to buy one.\nCharge 5 - I ordered this one straight from Fitbit.com since Fitbit was nice enough to give me a discount for this one... but it's completely dead.

The tracker is advertised as being waterproof and suitable for swimmers, yet it cannot hold up to water and regular activity conditions for longer than 2 months.

Part of the reason I purchased this particular tracker was for the \"daily readiness score\", a feature that wasn't available for 3 months until after the rollout of the Charge 5. Premium memberships are $85 for the year, so I was paying for a service I was not even able to use.

I got nothing close to that. Turns out this is an issue you can find in the Fitbit community forum, a resource open to all registered users. As others who experienced the same problem reported, I had turned off GPS, set notification vibrations to normal, and disabled \"always on display.\" I also reset the device. None of it helped. Didn't get much past 24 hours before receiving a low battery warning via email. By contrast, a full charge on my wife's Inspire 2 easily lasts a week. Yes it has fewer features and is harder to read with its black and white smaller face, particularly in direct sunlight. But it connects to the same app and comes with a year's free premium trial instead of only 6 months. (Dumb marketing thinking on Fitbit's part, IMO). So I'm \"trading down\" to my wife's model. I also found the Charge 5's menu counterintuitive and clunky in some areas. If you watch Charge 5 YouTube vids you'll find that even relatively experienced users struggle at times to get the device to behave as you'd expect. Bottom line: I'd have kept the Charge 5 if not for its poor battery life.",

        "text": "It’s not a terrible device, but it’s more of a “gimmick” than anything. As of this review, there are hardly any apps for the Charge 5 and the ones they do have aren’t very useful. The wrist gestures are sluggish, and you might find yourself constantly having to tap the screen to get it to come on. Unfortunately, this has the side-effect of changing the home screen, so you’ll have to keep tapping to get back to whatever metric you wanted to see. This procedure gets a little old after 20 or so times.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is that this device DOES NOT track your oxygen levels (SpO2) in real-time. It only takes measurements while you sleep and even then, it only uses those measurements as an estimate. I believe the manufacturer knew this would be a pain point for Fitbit owners (there are LOTS of complaints in the forums) and they deliberately hid this shortcoming when they advertised the Charge 5 features on their website. It’s not until you use the device and go digging in their technical articles or forums that you realize you’ve been duped. There are some posts that say there’s a clock-face that does display the Oxygen levels in real-time, but I couldn’t find any for the Charge 5.\n\nTheir app does have some fancy charts, but to display any useful information, you'll have to purchase a subscription. Without it, you're restricted to the most basic of data. They’re just another company out to nickel-and-dime you for whatever they can get.\n\nIn my opinion, if you want a product that is ground-up designed for fitness tracking, then spend the extra money and purchase a Garmin. Yes, they are more expensive (considerably in some cases) but you’ll quickly find you do indeed get what you pay for.\n\nOverall, I’d categorize this device as a toy, and as such, this charge 5 has found its way to the wrist of my young niece who gets a kick out of seeing how many steps she's taken in a day.",

        "text": "I am usually wary of 1- or 2-star reviews because people find one little thing that they complain about and it's usually user error or not that relevant, and I rarely give them myself, but I cannot tell a lie: After purchasing, then returning, then repurchasing at a deep discount a Charge 5, this former Charge 2 user is truly disappointed in the Charge 5. I'm happy if others love theirs; mine has just enough issues that make me wish I'd never bought it:\n1) The available faces are overdesigned and difficult to read, and there's no simple default view combination of date, steps, heart rate; there are hundreds of complaints about this on the Fitibit website for several months now, but nothing's been done. It can't be that difficult to simplify the display code.\n2) Syncing with my phone app is very slow. When I open the app on my phone it always, by default, first flashes \"Couldn't sync\" and it often takes three flicks of the screen to activate; that could be because the sleep score isn't visible on the Fitbit itself, long after I'm out of bed (see photo); the slowness here (often over a minute or two) is a huge complaint;\n3) Truly stupid is that long after you've ended a phone call, there are \"Active call\" notifications displaying and you have to scroll down through them to \"Clear all.\"\n4) As with the Charge 2, the step and sleep calculations are, at best, approximations. One night the device did not register that I had fallen asleep until 4 in the morning (about three hours after I had crawled in bed). It's discouraging, at times, not always, to be walking around and not see a single step registered;\n5) Initial heartbeat calculation when I start the treadmill is usually way off (too high), settles down after a few minutes.\n6) It's just unpredictable: One day, while walking the treadmill, I looked at my Charge 5 and suddenly it was the next day/date and my steps had restarted. This later resolved itself.\nI've reset the device several times in hopes of it performing better, but that doesn't help. Most annoying is the syncing. I'll probably keep this device for a while, at least till new Apple watches are released, and then see what my options are. If only I could revive my Charge 2!",

        "text": "Some background info: I have been a triathlete for years. I have used Garmin devices half of my life and I track data most of the time such as running dynamics, cadence, and heart rate. I have prior history of using Fitbit watch for 2 years back around 2017-18. Now, I got the Charge 5 because I don’t want the bulkiness from the Sense because Charge 5 practically tracks the same thing as Sense (except a few things like the ABC so no stairs climbed will be measured). I tried Charge 5 for 3 days (including sleep and exercising) and one of the days I compared it side-by-side against a Garmin watch.\n\nMy quick summary: it is an excellent fitness tracking band but if you crave for something more than just basic tracking, look elsewhere.\n\nDisclaimer: I tried it under free fitbit app because I wanted to see what I get from the free app since the membership price per year is outrageous (I am aware there is a 6-month free trial).\n\nHere is my in-depth analysis:\nWear/appearance/design: I did like the charge 5 and its band. It is comfortable once you’ve adjusted to the correct area. I often forget I was wearing it most of the time. I have no problem wearing it overnight and no skin rash or anything after the 3rd day. I wear dress shirts during the day and it is slim and nicely hiding under my cuff. The display is vibrant and easy to read.\n\nAll-day continuous heart rate tracking: Their 24/7 PurePulse tech records your rate every 5 minutes. Garmin does it every 2 min. When I was wearing my garmin + charge 5 together for 24 hours, I can see a big deviation between both devices. The RHR for fitbit says 54-55 for me and for Garmin (from years of history tracking me) says 46-48 RHR. The HR graph is also friendlier to read on Garmin than fitbit. There is also more HR fluctuation throughout the day seen from fitbit than Garmin (perhaps because it measures every 5 min?). All in all, it is a bit questionable for me here.\n\nEDA and ECG: I tried them but I don’t know if they are accurate. Even if they are not, it only tells me if I am sinus rhythm or not. I guess these are good features for individuals with heart concern or family hx of heart diseases.\n\nSpO2, Heart Rate Variability, breathing rate, and skin temp: Yes fitbit tracks them, but you cannot interact with/open the graph to see how you did throughout the night/day. Garmin tracks respiration, pulse-ox, HR, and stress in real-time and I can track on the graph exactly when and what 24/7.\n\nSteps tracking: For some reason, Fitbit is always ~250-300 steps more than Garmin at the end of the day. Not sure why but that is not a big difference. Charge 5 has no ABC so it doesn’t track floors climbed.\n\nSleep tracking: As mentioned above, RHR in fitbit is higher than my Garmin. It may be due to the type of sensor or other errors I’m not sure yet.\n\nSmartTrack: I have done a 10k track workout and a 1.5 hr ride with some tempo zones 2-3. On the run, fitbit sensed it and the GPS is somewhat accurate (but it’s like spaghetti lines, not precise). HR tracking was fair compared to my garmin wrist HR. Then for cycling, the fitbit sensed it but started recording late. It also inaccurately track my HR to be much lower than my garmin heart rate chest strap that I have been using for years. Fitbit says my highest HR was 142 v.s. 166 on Garmin. I know garmin wins in this one for sure. Fitbit also doesn’t allow me to look at my exercising HR graph. If I go to another tab to see my overall HR tracking, the graph does not appear accurate at all. It is simply disappointing for cycling. I didn’t even want to bother trying it in the pool.\nFree Fitbit app impression: I did my research on this prior purchasing. The only thing the Premium will get me is the 30 day trends, stress management, videos (which you can easily find online these days), and few other things I don’t care for. If you don’t care much for detailed graphs and numbers, free is enough for you. Premium is a rip-off.\n\nBattery: it went from 100% to about 18% by the end of the 3rd day. I only sync with my phone twice a day (AM and PM). I left always-on display off. So 7-day battery life seems to be a long-stretch.\n\nOverall: I’d give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars mainly because it does a good job tracking things but I don’t think it is there yet. I have also considered my possible bias towards it since I am comparing it with Garmin. But with my 2 years previous background with Fitbit, I do think Fitbit has improved a lot since 2017 but still need a bit more. I do think Charge 5 is great for a fitness-minded, non-competitive or non-data driven person.",

I was quite surprised, honestly. I read hundreds of reviews on many low to mid-tier trackers and watches and this one fit the bill and put me way under the price point I was going for. one of the biggest things for me is the battery life, I was only capable of getting 2 full days out of my Samsung having to charge it every other night which made sleep tracking pointless, with this watch I can easily wear it for 5+ days straight and still have a 30% charge. Given, the band is as comfortable as well and I have no issue wearing it day after day (note: I take it off occasionally to give me skin a break or if I'm going to shower). Charging is a breeze too - with the included dock I am able to fully charges the way within 20 minure=e=, I am not a power user who uses it to track every walk and exercise, nor am I running GPS all the time either both of which work very well too. I have the view set to manual instead of flicking my wrist to turn on the watch. I like how quickly displays notifications once received. another pro for this watch is how aggressive you can set the vibration to be, works great when used for alarms you cannot miss. switching time zones when driving out from Phoenix to northern New Mexico, very little effort was needed from me to update the time. I work in a labor intensive warehouse where this thing is banged up by packages and equipment all day long and I have yet to see any physical damage to the unit. if you are looking for something inexpensive, not bulky, and durable with a long lasting battery - this is a great option!",

I even had my watch fall off in a public toilet once...lovely but at least I was able to sent the charge 5 through the wash thanks to the robust waterproofing.\n\nBuy at your own risk because you may be looking around in your yard or retracing your steps through a parking lot to find your wayward tracker.",

I use it to track running, swimming and cycling.\nI was very interested in this when it came out but have seen some reviews complaining that the built-in GPS is inaccurate and sometimes loses the satellite lock. But I decided to take a chance and just return it if I had problems.\nI've gone on two runs so far, and while it's not quite as accurate as my phone GPS, I have nothing to complain about. Distance was very close, and the only issues I've seen have been rounding off sharp corners a little bit or sometimes showing me on the opposite side of the road.\nI also love how light it is compared with my Versa.\nSo far, so good!",

I have now been through two Charge 5 trackers in the past three months. Both trackers had issues with their battery. The first one worked fine for about two weeks, but then stopped tracking steps and kept changing the date and time. I would look at the watch around noon on Monday and the display would show it was sometime the following day. I had to keep restarting the devise to reset it. Online forums noted the problem was battery being loose. I wound up breaking the tracker when following independent instructions on how to fix this. My fault here for attempting to follow an independent video.\n\nI bought a second Charge 5, this time on Amazon. I thought if I bought one from a different location, I wouldn't have the same problems. From the beginning, the new one wouldn't hold a charge for a full day. I again researched the issue online (on Fitbit's forum) and found that this a known, ongoing issue. I did follow all of the recommendations Fitbit offered for saving the battery life which basically boils down to disabling every feature this devise offers (GPS, Always On, etc) and constantly restarting. Even after doing all of this, the charge still does not last 24 hours. I noticed on the forum that Fitbit posted that they were working on a software patch for the known battery drain issues, but didn't see any type of follow up.\n\nI should also note that the wrist band on both of the Charge 5 trackers caused a severe burn-like rash on my wrists. I had to buy replacement bands to alleviate this . I did not have any similar issues with any of my previous Fitbit trackers.\n\nI am extremely disappointed in the Charge 5 and would definitely not recommend it.",

After researching I bought both the Amazfit 5 and the Fitbit 5. I have been riding with both and for my needs I prefer the Amazfit over the $100 more expensive Fitbit. Here are a couple deciding factors for my decision:\n\n- Amazfit (AF) provides on demand O2 readings, Fitbit (FB) only track sleeping O2 levels.\n\n- While the FB has GPS, I found the battery drain considerable (I left on a 3 hour ride with 20% and it was dead before I finished). AF does not have GPS but linking with Strava provided the GPS needed for tracking. For me I always ride with my phone GPS anyway.\n\n-One thing I miss with Strava that I had with Map My Ride was split time call-outs. AF through the Zepp app gives me real-time audible mile split times and current heart rate. I did not see that feature on the FB.\n\n- I will say I prefer the styling, face size, and fit of the FB\n\n- The Alexa feature on the AF is also a plus\n\nMany fitness trackers cater to runners and are short on features for cyclists. The inexpensive AF tracker fits my cycling needs better than the FB",

(for example imagine what this meens when biking). An always-on option is not available, and the built-in automatic turn-on never works properly.\n\nEven when you do manage to see the screen, all data other than the time (e.g. heart rate... as in \"fitness watch\") is in TINY font, and requires multiple taps to reach - every time again. Imagine to try reading tiny font while running, and while both hands are atressed, to manage this.\n\nOne main reason I chose this, and was willing to pay over $200, is because it's supposed to have GPS - I was hoping to track and log my route while biking. Unfortunately, there is no sign of any GPS or location related functionality anywhere on the device or the app!\n\nNow let's forget \"fitness\", and talk \"watch\". This \"watch\" forgets the time every time the battery is depleted!!! - as opposed to any smart device out there.\n\nIf this is not enough - you can't set the time from the \"watch\" itself!!!\nAnd instead, you need to use the app on your phone, have internet connection, and connect to their server (!!!) - only to set the correct time!\n\nI'm so sorry I got it, and wonder how reviews on appreciated tech sites fail to mention such fundamental flaws.",

This device allows you to track six activities. However, two I regularly use, walking and outdoor workout, were not in the list. All you have to do is go to \"exercise shortcuts,\" and drop some and add from the list up to six total. Sadder, however, is the fact that the 5 has stopped tracking stairs. I have badges, including the Lighthouse badge for doing 50 stairs in a day, but I guess it's all flatland from now until they get enough complaints to change back to encouraging stair climbing again.

I like that it looks like a bracelet (black), but come on; give me a break. a little over a year and it is dead? I had some \"screen issues\" a few months ago, but then the device decided to \"self repair\" (or was it a miracle?).\nAnyways, the price is right, but I have to think what the next device will be.\n\nThis review is being written while frustrated. I just received the Charge 5 -- my 3rd Fitbit device.\nThe 2 stars (may change) is because I have spent about an hour to connect it with my app (IOS is up-to-date). Half the time was spent connecting the device to the app. Now, I am waiting for the updates. It gets (at most) up to 17% and then it crashes. My internet connection is fine.

I enjoy the moving prompts throughout the day including the challenge of getting 250 steps/hour. The app is easy to navigate, though it's worth noting that Fitbit charges you a ridiculous subscription price just to use most of the features that come with the device. Also, if this sort of thing matters to you, 98% of the available watch faces are garish and ugly, and there doesn't seem to be developer support for creating new ones.\n\nThe main reason I bought the Charge 5 was to track my HR during HIIT workouts. It takes forever for my HR to come down once it's elevated, so I needed to know that my HR had slowed before performing the next sprint. Well, the Fitbit HR monitor is not even close to accurate. After doing an hour intensive workout it recorded my max HR as 125bpm. I looked into it, and apparently this is a widespread problem with Fitbit's latest generation of devices. Other models seem to have the same problem.\n\nThis was a dealbreaker for me. It may not be for you. All of the other features seemed to work well.\n\nI spent a little extra and got a Garmin Venu 2s and the features are so much more robust than what Fitbit has to offer, I don't think I will ever go back to the company.

Likely caused by providing the more smooth silicone surface, versus the rubbery skin/hair gripping silicone surface.\n\nI also called Amazon.com, rather than returning an apparently fine functioning device, extend the return period from 30 to 60 days, to further troubleshoot the wrist band problem.

I got agreement to fix an issue 2 months ago and fitbit gave me a label to ship it back. 2 months later, the package still hasn't been delivered. fitbit says it's not their fault and won't ship me a replacement until it arrives.

Watch is slim and comfortable enough to wear without noticing.\n\nThe bad: TOO DAMN SLOW. Seriously, navigating through the menus is so sluggish, and I have to constantly swipe 3 or 4 times just to get it to register one swipe. If you need to tell the time it takes a solid second for the gesture to turn on the watch which is annoying, it's quicker to just double tap the screen to turn it on to see the time. We cannot download custom watch faces, they all have be the official Fitbit watch faces which all IMO look horrible. I just need the time, seconds, and my BPM but they're all minimalist rainbow vomit watch faces that barely provide ANY information (usually it's JUST the time and maybe the date if you're lucky. No seconds, and you have to tap through to see your HR, oh and the time is in tiny text because most of the watch face is composed of that rainbow vomit design). It's literally built form over function. I found one that I sort of liked and left it at that, but if you hate all 9 of the watch faces you are SOL because there are no custom faces.\n\nBattery is rated for 7 days.

Watch 7 typically only last for 1 day. Charge 5 stated the battery can last for 7 days, but I usually only get 2 days of battery life. After doing some research and going through past reviews, I found out that I’m experiencing the same battery drain as other reviewers have mentioned. Every hour the battery percentages goes down by 5%. That’s a crazy amount of battery. Furthermore, the touch sensor is horrible, it lags most of the time or not responsive.

My only complaint (which I’ve also had with my previous Fitbits) is that the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone is wonky. I get notifications of some phone calls, but then other times the notification doesn’t come through, even when it still looks like the Fitbit is paired with the phone. Text notifications are also inconsistent. I can’t figure it out. It’s disappointing that I can’t rely on this function, because part of the reason I have a Fitbit is so I can put my phone down in another room but still know if I’m getting a call or text.

If you need siri or the ability to respond to texts/emails etc on the wrist- look elsewhere. the charge 5 really is for focusing on fitness/sleep/mindfulness goals and not missing urgent calls/texts.",

To make it worse, you have to FIGHT with customer service to even have them consider a replacement under warranty. It took me 5 chat sessions and a phone call to get one under the warranty. They will blame the user for having features turned on (like Always on Display or GPS) as the cause, even if you have those features disable. They always claim 'well, our system shows you have those turned on'. It is INCREDIBLY frustrating.\n\nI challege anyone who reads this to search the web for \"Charge 5 battery draining too fast\" and look for the official Fitbit Community website. It's, by far, the most popular thread.\n\nIn the end, as far as the device itself, it's perfect, as long as it's got a charge.

I have tried everything I could find online: I've done the 1-, 2-, and 3-finger distance from the wrist trick; I have worn it tighter and looser on my wrist; I have worn it higher and lower on my arm. The product either (a) cannot find my active heart rate or (b) continually misreads my active heart rate.\n\nWhile at the gym, I find that I spend more time fidgeting with this Fitbit than focusing on my cardio workouts. If the Fitbit does not sit in just the right position on my upper-wrist/arm while exercising, the product misreads my active heart rate by (anywhere from) 30 to 60 beats per minute. If/when I can find that \"just right spot\" on my arm, the product tends to slip and the Fitbit loses my active heart rate again. Further, because I sweat a lot during my cardio workouts, the sweat interferes with the sensors and, again, the Fitbit cannot accurately read my active heart rate. Also, if my arm/wrist is larger than normal on a given morning, the Fitbit wristband may be too tight or too loose and, again, the Fitbit cannot accurately read my heart rate.\n\nI am beyond frustrated and extremely disappointed with this product. I debated whether to buy a Fitbit for years. When I finally pulled the trigger, this is what I have experienced. Worse, when I researched fitness trackers online, articles pointed toward Fitbit. Nevertheless, this fitness technology is flawed.\n\nI would not recommend this tracker to anyone.",

When you start exercising, when you speed up, when you slow down, when you have been active for so long, every time you go between heart rate zones, when you’ve burned so many calories, when you reach a milestone…\n\nIf you are playing golf, bowling, shooting, or any other sport where you need to concentrate - you will jerk when this thing goes off. And there isn’t a way to turn it off now like there was before.\n\nDo not purchase unless maybe you have broken your wrist before and have no feeling in it…\n\nUpdate - I tracked it today while walking for 28 minutes and I had 16 vibrations. 16! One was, I found out at the end, a notification that my battery was at 20%. You mean that during an exercise its important for me to know that I have two days of battery left? As for the other 15 vibrations I have no clue what they were for as they were all the same length and without stopping my walk to stare at my arm - I couldn't tell you what they were for. The reason this is bad is because if you’re playing a sport that requires some sort of focus - archery, golf, serving in tennis, shooting sports, bowling, etc. - you don’t want a buzzer hitting you while you’re having to focus. I’ve had this thing for less than a month and my target calories were reached during bowling twice. So I changed my tracked target to distance ad set it at 20,000 steps in a day. But it still buzzes when I move into and out of heart rate zones and there isn’t a way to turn that off from what I’ve found. Has to be the most poorly designed software ever.\n\nBut I can now use my fitbit to purchase stuff - so that works for me to purchase stuff while I am walking or jogging around my hood...\n\nUpdate #3 - now its popping up during exercise and telling me that I'm walking too fast. Walking too fast?!? What? I can't wait for this thing to die.",

My family all prefer Apple iWatches, but the Fitbit Charge 5 (and previously Charge 2, 3, 4) are the best watch for me after trying many. The fitbit batteries lasts almost a week (the Apple iWatches last a day or 1.5 days before requiring charging). I prefer the shape/size of the Fitibit Charge 5 also. The Fitbit sleep app is superior to the Apple iWatch std and add ins that I found/used. The last Fitbit Charge 5 I ordered (via Amazon thank) didn't work (right out of the box after charging), and I'm sure that is/was an exception - my families & friends fitbits (many) have been perfect. But for this exception (bad screen), Fitbit's \"chat\" support was lacking - had me \"keep attempting to synch\" over a weekend \"...to get a patch\", and \"...contact us in 2 days..\". On the next Monday after asking for video's of the screen, and a few additional attempts to reboot/change screen were unsuccessful, Fitbit support confirmed the Charge 5 needed to be replaced. They emailed me Q's that had already been answered 2 or 3 times by phone. then, Fitbit emailed with their timeframe - they would have me ship the watch back, and after they received it, they would ship me a new Fitbit Charge 5. Their timeframe was up to...., 24 calendar days from when I reported the issue. I chose to let Amazon replace it - had a new watch in 2 days. Still think Fitbit Charge 5 is the best for me, but I'm 100% sure Fitbit's warranty process is ripe for \"leaning\" and making customer centric. Hat's off to Amazon for their lean/quick processes and amazing warranty response.\n\nUpdate - the Fitbit Charge 5 failed (2nd failure) after 6.5 months - the green heart rate monitor light came on solid and won't go off. Took qty 3 chats working with Fitbit's crazy terrible customer svc team. Unbelievable. No customer svc claims by email. Chat or by phone. When you chat - if they ask you for a photo or video, or other, and it takes over a minute...., they can (and did in my case - twice) disconnect. If you need a replacement device - be prepared to waited 21 to 24 calendar days. Fitbit has the worlds worst customer service. PCMag says the Fitbit Charge 5 is a good/great product, and other articles that compare it to Garmin say the Charge 5 is the better tracker/watch - but....., my conclusion is - if you are like me - and you want to be sure you have a watch/tracker available..., you will have to purchase qty 2 of these Charge 5's - one to use, the other one being replaced (very slowly) by Fitbit.",

To keep things brief, I bought this primarily for the calories burned, heart rate, and sleep tracking. If you are sweating furing your workout, as one does, this will autmatically put your heart rate in the 60s or 70s. So, after doing 60 minutes of sweaty labor in the gym, you might go check your fitbit and see you had 10 total minutes of fat burn or cardio time. Wtf? Is this not the PRIMARY purpose fo this thing? Without the heart rate accurately tracking, the calorie tracking is also thrown off, so that is 2/3 features I purchased this for that don't work when working out (which is when you want to know what's going on with your hear rate and calories). Finally, sleep scores are literally NEVER correct or even measured. You have to delete your sleep data, remember the times you marked yourself as asleep and awake, and manually re-enter that info for the app to accurately calculate your sleep score and times in light, deep, and REM sleep.\n\nOk so not finally... the last thing I'll mention, you might want to check your fitbit in the middle of a session, if you had a text come in, for some reason the screen switches to a different screen, whatever, you will never ever ever get back to the main screen to see your primary stats in the moment. The swiping, swishing, flicking, etc it takes to get to a main home screen is beyond aggravating, and no matter what settings I adjust, the texts just keep on a'coming.

Second night i thought I would test it sightly. Told the app i was going to sleep but instead watched tv for an hour. The next day the app said i fell asleep in 14 minutes which was completely false. The third night the app tracked and said i slept soundly through the night. Problem is that i got up twice to go to the bathroom yet the device said i had not woken or even had a restless period during the night. Each day i try to get the O2 amounts and the app says i have to sleep with the device on which i have done each day. Resting heart rate tracked for one day but not the other two for some reason.

Especially the improved health metrics (breathing rate, heart rate variability), activity score, and stress management.\nOn most of the features I would say this tracker is just as accurate as any other, however I don’t completely trust the sleep information. The device often marks me as sleeping if I sit still for a certain amount of time, like if I’m reading or watching TV. Also, if I wake up in the morning but stay in bed to surf my phone for 20 or 30 minutes before getting up, it marks that as sleeping. and, what really frustrates me is if I have insomnia and I am literally awake for one to two hours in the middle of the night thinking, if I do not get out of bed, it will mark that as light sleep or as a REM sleep.\nFor the EDA monitor on this device, like many others have noted, it actually is not relaxing for me at all. My heart rate goes up while I am trying to use it. Partly it’s the way it is designed and how you have to pinch the sides of device with two fingers of your opposite hand for 3 minutes. Other devices allow you to just lay your palm over the top of the device which is far more relaxing and intuitive.\nFor my first two Fitbits, I did not pay for premium subscription because I did not think they offered very many features.

        "text": "December 2022 update\n\nMaybe 2-3 months back they released a software update for the watch. That changed the battery life tremendously. I don't really pay attention, but I expect I get around 5 days on a charge, give or take.\n\nSince that software update I've been very happy with this device. Would buy again if the device eventually fails.\n\n### end update\n\n2 month update: April 2022\n\n* I like the sleep data on this watch. It's useful and appears to be relatively accurate. It's about the only thing I really like on this watch outside of its bright display.\n\n* The band has grown on me. It's still annoying and gets in my way when typing, but it's pretty robust. I don't know if you can have it both ways: a band that doesn't get in your way and a band that is strong / sturdy.\n\n* With great consistency battery life seems better when charging to less than 100%. Maybe it's a fluke with my unit, but more times than not, charging to 100% results in shorter use time between charges. I stopped daily monitoring my battery usage, but have had 3-4 days usage between charges as well as a little over 2 days. Be warned, however: the battery is like a vehicle's fuel tank that narrows on the bottom: once you start getting to 40-30%, battery life can go quick. At least on my device. I can't say whether rebooting has helped on an ongoing basis.\n\n* This thing does not seem to have the capacity to be used as a realtime heartrate tracker. I think the heartrate tracking is accurate (based on checking against multiple different devices), however, the data I see on my watch seems to lag behind reality. Looking at my exported logs I see gaps of 5,10 and 15 seconds between heartrate data points, and I'm not certain the watch display updates as frequently as data is collected. Maybe it does, but you'd have to look at the source code to confirm. From my perspective, looking at my heartrate on my device is more akin to, \"my heartrate was likely xx bpm within the last 30 seconds or so\", not \"my heartrate is xx bpm right now\". I know it's accurate at rest, eventually, but I have no way of testing against other devices while I'm moving. Maybe this is something unique to me and/or my device, but it's frustrating. I think if you want a realtime heartrate monitor for exercise, I would not use this device.\n\nI've lowered my rating to 2 stars.\n\n### end update\n\nI had an Inspire HR for nearly 2 years before buying this, so this will be compared to that. I bought this outside of Amazon.\n\nTLDR; - this watch is okay. Battery life out of the box is garbage, but appears you can improve that. Band is thick, which can be noticed if you spend time on a keyboard or do other things where your wrist is in close proximity to a hard surface. Some watch / app features require premium membership, which won't be worth it to some people.\n\nWould I buy this again? Maybe. If the price was right and there weren't potentially better options at a reasonably-higher price point.\n\nReview and more info:\n\nI've had this watch for about 2 weeks. The first day or two, the battery was nearly fully discharging every day. I decided to start tracking it, and that is my attached image. On day 2/3, when I started tracking, I was dropping about 3.3% battery life per hour. This is just wearing it. I don't exercise in the traditional sense and don't use watch notification things, so it's just an accessory that tracks my steps, sleep and heart rate, more or less. That's all I use it for.\n\nI looked into it, found you could disable or offload the GPS to your phone, which I'm assuming is what made the biggest difference, unless the watch just needed a reboot after the firmware update. My first reboot took place after disabling GPS, so I can't be sure which caused the behavior change, or if it was something else entirely that improved battery life at that time.\n\nAt this point I'm getting 3-4 days between charges. Not 4 days, but possibly over 72 hours sometimes. It's acceptable.\n\nThe band, 2 weeks in, and I can't get used to it. It's a minor hindrance as I sit here and type this, or when I sit at my desk and type anything. I can probably / hopefully find a thinner band. The band itself is comfortable enough, I guess, though if you have large wrists, the band may be too small. I'm an ideal-weight person and am on the last adjustment hole. Maybe they made the band backwards: the tightest settings I don't think would fit around an average / large dog's leg, which is certainly smaller than most human wrists.\n\nIf you have the default strap too tight, it will leave impressive marks on your skin, much more so than I saw with the Inspire HR.\n\nPossibly the EKG is useful. I think the skin temp feature is kind of gimmicky in that it only tests at night, can be affected by your arm placement and ambient temperature and really they don't seem to advertise why it's a useful metric anyway. Likewise the Sp02, only checking at night, which is really less useful and incredibly limiting compared to what I thought it'd be by reading over the sales material before purchase.\n\nCertainly the brightness of the display is substantially improved over the Inspire HR.\n\nI rate this a half-hearted 3.5 out of 5. It's not that I'm all that dissatisfied with it, but I'm also not impressed. The things that I like about it over my last Fitbit get washed out because of the still-unimpressive battery life for the watch to exist, the awkward band and features that don't have obvious health-interest benefits, or are so limited in implementation that they're not really worth mentioning as a selling point unless you want to disappoint people once they see how they actually work.\n\nThe watch is supposed to do way more than what I use it for, and if I intended to use my watch as a true fitness tracker and notification beacon, I would expect to have to charge this up to 1x-2x per day based on my experience thus far. If that were the case for me, I'd be buying anything else at any price point because at that point, there would be zero value in having this device.",

I chose the Charge5 over all the other options (as well as Apple Watches and their competitors) for several reasons.\n\nThe first was purely aesthetic. I don't care for huge clock faces, and this one looked perfect for me. There's nothing but smooth edges so it really can't get snagged on anything, either.\n\nBeyond that, I liked the larger display, and the improvement in heart rate accuracy is fantastic. I can't say it's 100% correct, but I've worked out for decades and have a very good feel about where the rate should be, and this tracks with that quite closely.\n\nThe color display is also very much appreciated as it was often difficult to read the black & white numbers on the Inspire2.\n\nIf you need a solid, middle-of-the-road fitness tracker, and if the thin profile works for you, this is a really sound choice.",

The simplicity of the earlier models was part of the original draw. It is still probably simpler than more complex smart watches\ndesigns, maybe a planned obsolescence.\n\nThe band attachment is also a different design that hopefully will avoid the issues where bands couldn't stay on for Charge 3 that made the Charge 3 unusable after a while.

I may or may not actually get up, but go back to sleep at 2:50am. The next morning the tracking data says I began my sleep cycle at 2:50am and completely ignores my first three hours of sleep! What's worse was that sometimes it recognized the awake time as part of a larger sleep cycle and sometimes it didn't. Explanations of how it collects data are pointless. It either has the ability to do it under real life circumstances or should it not claim that it does.\nI also had a problem with the blood oxygen feature display either not visible or not working.

After wearing it for two weeks I got fed up with having to charge it every single day and being robbed of heart rates (the device would consistently go from 160+ bpm to 80 and not move for the duration of a 20 minute exercise) and went to exchange it at Target where I purchased it. I charged the new device fully then began update and setup. It worked for literally 5 hours before completely shutting off and being unresponsive. I finished my workout and plugged it in once home only for it to blink the logo non stop. I flipped it over to look at the sensors and there's condensation inside it...from my sweat. It's infuriating and will not be utilizing this brand any longer for wasting my time.",

The display has fully meat my expectations. I can see the readouts much better in daylight, and the colors provide a more pleasant view. While new features like the EDA scan, and ECG are nice to have, I probably won’t find a real practical purse to use them on a regular basis. The big negatives with the product so far has been the GPS tracking (using phone), heart rate monitoring, and sleep monitoring. All these features seem to sporadically work. When I jog I get dropped GPS, and partial heart rate data. At night I sometimes get no detection of sleep mode, or it reads about half the night as sleep and drops the rest. I bought it sale thinking I was getting a good deal but now I’m think that Fitbit was trying to unload inventory due to mounting problems with the product.",

Unlike the 3 and 4, the 5 has a brilliant and easy to read screen (even in bright outdoor light) which is a clear improvement over the others. It was also easy to pair and get it up and running.\n\nHowever, it no longer has an altimeter, which means that it cannot tell or record whether you've just climbed a mountain or walked on a flat bit along city streets. It also, in my experience at least, has a much shorter battery life than the 3 or 4. I used it for most of a week (with screen on the older mode and phone GPS) and woke up with it fully discharged 2 of the five days that I used. Moreover, the phone GPS never worked as well it did with the old Charge 3. The new menu is also a bit strange in that to get to specific exercise requires shift at least 2 screens rather than one, which seems odd for an exercise tracker.\n\nSo after the second dead fitbit morning, I decided to send it back to Amazon. The new screen is a great addition, but the subtractions were too many and too much, so I've shifted back to the 4.\n\nPS since returning the 5, I've tried a Samsung 4, sleek, but with only 24 hr battery life, and apps that made me appreciate the fitbit app more than I had. It does count stairs and does a few more useful things than the 5, and is far easier to read outdoors than the 4, ... so I'll probably use it until the charge 6 arrives. still thinking about it.",

I was shocked to see how many times I wake up for 1 to 5 minutes per night without any recollection. How little “Deep Sleep” and “REM Sleep” I get per night. I’ve learned that those dreams that go on for hours can actually happen in 3 minutes just before I wake up in the morning. I’m 62 years old, retired, a widower with AFib and arthritis in nearly every joint. I can actually see my heart settle into a steady sinus rhythm as my meds kick in and start bouncing around again before my next dose 12 hours later. Same with the pain killers at night. I move very little until they begin to wear off, then my sleep becomes very restless and start flopping around like a fish. On bad nights I wake up 2-3 times an hour. My average resting heartbeats per minute is 60. On two nights while asleep last month the data showed sudden drops to 40 bpm for a few minutes. These are all things I would never known without this watch. Data that I can show my doctors and ask questions about. Is this serious? Should we change when I take my meds? Should we change meds? I’m still learning all the features of the watch and the App, in fact, I’ve just scratched the surface of all it can do. Highly recommend this amazing technology with one exception meant without sounding condescending. If you worry and consider making a doctors appointment every time you have a heart palpitation, wake up with a stiff shoulder or a slightly sore throat, all the data this watch traces may scare the heck out of you.

It's unfortunate they don't include a jackhammer inn the box, which is what you will need in order to double-tap the thing hard enough to wake it up. It usually takes several attempts. Even if you enable the always-on display, it will still only show the time and maybe some basic stuff. But even with always-on display, you STILL need to wake it up before interacting with it. On top of this, there are a handful of glitches. If you leave the stopwatch running overnight by accident, the main menu will glitch and you won't be able to scroll though all the options until you force-reset it. How this is unfixed three months after launch is beyond me. Battery level is alry pretty glitchy - it can go from 43% to 19% in 15 minutes, then jump to 35% after a minute of charging. Sometimes during exercise it will just die (despite starting out at 90%) or if you're hiking for maybe an hour, sometimes it will just randomly exit exercise mode.\n\nThe app experience is beyond repugnant. On every screen there is an upsell reminding you that you're \"missing out\" because you don't have \"PREMIUM!!!\" and how you can \"unlock\" the full whatever of the thing you just spent money on. Fitbit is already making a tremendous amount of money selling your information to data brokers, probably including everyone you come in contact with. Isn't that enough?\n\nEvery once in a while, the app has POP-UP ADS. That's right, they're right there in the app for a thing you paid for, urging you to buy more of their products. And there's no way to turn that off. Are you kidding me?\n\nAnd if that weren't enough, there are daily in-app notifications for all their garbage services, including, for some reason, some kind of partnership with Deepak Chopra, the king of pseudoscience himself? They occupy half the screen and you CAN'T TURN THIS CRAP OFF unless you reverse-engineer the android app (which I eventually did).\n\nTo top it off, the app has the audacity to give you a pop-up nagging you to rate the product on Amazon.

I tried to purchase that bundle several times, but the Fitbit system wouldn't allow me to add a new premium membership to my account due to my existing premium membership not expiring yet.\n\nAfter reaching out to Fitbit via chat and phone call (at least 4-5 times), all customer service agents assured me that the system would recognize that I was attempting to purchase the premium plan. They pushed me to purchase my cart as-is and that I would be prompted to set up my premium plan 3 days after my existing plan ended. Even though that was the suggestion I was continually given, that was clearly not a good choice.\n\nSince that purchase, I've reached out to customer service via email, chat, phone call, and Twitter DM and they have completely ignored me. Every time I get in contact with a customer service agent, they direct me to their support email address, which has neglected to respond to any of my emails past the introductory email.\n\nI was tricked into purchasing the Charge5 and 2-year protection plan at full price. I've been a loyal Fitbit user for years, I have even convinced 5 of my family members to purchase Fitbit devises, but this experience has completely tarnished the brand.

I like all the extra functionality compared to the Fitbit 3.\n\nOne major improvement is the charging cable, they made it magnetic so it perfectly clicks to the back of the device, no more fiddling with a clip on style, one warning though, be careful to not allow the magnetic part attach itself to anything metal while it's plugged into power, I melted a charging cable that was similar to this a few years back.\n\nOne thing I wish could be changed, I'd like to be able to pause the step counter, I drive on an unpaved, bumpy road for about 6 miles (12 miles both ways) to get out of my neighborhood, it counts those bumps as steps adding hundreds of steps I didn't do. I also had to go in on the auto exercise tracker and push the bike tracking up to 30 minutes (it defaults at auto tracking at 15 minutes), it was mistaking my traveling in my truck on those bumpy roads as riding a bike.\n\nI'm still using the free 6 month premium membership, not sure if I'll pay to keep it when it expires, I had both the premium and free with my Fitbit 3 and was satisfied with the free version. I mainly want to know about my sleep and heart rate.",

EKG seemed to function properly. ( Just a guide ) App is friendly and easy to follow and understand. That is where it stopped for me. One cannot use the Charge 5 while doing everyday chores and rely on the step counter. These are a few examples, while standing in one spot not moving your feet, bending over to tie your shoes, getting dressed while sitting in chair, bending over to pick up something off the floor, vacuuming, emptying the dishwasher, etc. These and I know many more daily tasks I had done will add as little as seven and as many as hundreds of steps each time they are performed. Swept a 4ft x 33ft long sidewalk with broom going side to side and logged on over 1200 steps. ( My stride was set at 28 inches ) Not possible walking 33 ft but understandable using your arms to sweep. If you put the watch on just before you start a walk and take it off when you are finished the Fitbit is Extremely Accurate but you are defeating the purpose of the other programs built into the Charge 5. Don't know how the other tracking programs work, didn't try. If you are sitting at a desk while working, eating, watching TV, ect, most of the day, than this Fitbit does not add extra steps by moving your arm, but if you are an everyday working person and keep the Charge 5 on all day long you could be off thousands of steps at the end of the day with inaccurate readings on the associated programs relying on steps taken.",

I again consulted the Fitbit site and discovered that others had experienced similar issues. I followed the instructions but they did not fix the burn irritation. I've worn watches my entire life and have had no previous skin issues. I've since purchased a fabric band and the issue has stopped.

However, Fitbit has always been lacking when it comes to user friendliness. Now they have a GPS watch but its almost impossible to read the battery level. When you connect the charger you get a full screen battery reading which is great but it only lasts for about 1 second. When not on the charger, there is a minuscule battery reading that you need at least a 5X magnifying glass to read. GPS eats battery life like crazy. Not to mention, you might like to see what time it is, which is difficult with a dead battery.\nThe charger connection, like on all Fitbits, is sketchy. You never really know if your watch is charging or not. There have been many times that I thought it was charging only to come back 30 minutes later and find out it has less battery than when I put it on the charger -- unlike the iWatch that shows a large ~ 1/2 inch wide circle with the current charge -- while its charging.\nWhy is it so difficult for Fitbit to just add a battery level full window to the many scrolling windows on their watches?",

Then I adopted Google Fit to try and make use of their built in charts and metrics and stuff. About a year in, I decided to raise the bar a bit by incorporating a fitness tracker to automatically record bio metrics, and integrate the data with my existing suite of apps and stuff.\n\nThe Fitbit Charge 5 accomplishes this goal, although it wasn't really designed to be used this way. Instead, the device is bait to lure you into a paid subscription service. Without the subscription you need to use a lot of workarounds, like third party apps, to integrate the Fitbit data with whatever database you're compiling.\n\nThe heart rate monitor and sleep tracking are probably the most useful functions of the Charge 5, and you could replicate those functions with something much cheaper, in all likelihood. It has built in GPS but it can also use the GPS on your connected mobile device, in order to save battery. I use the built in GPS on runs, because I like to carry only minimum essentials. I have not used the Fitbit payments app, although I can see how that might be useful if you'd prefer not to carry around superfluous objects during your workouts.\n\nThe suggested retail price of this unit is too high, but if you can find it on sale for 25% off or more, I think its worth it. Just be aware that you'll either have to implement some workarounds, or else pay extra for a subscription to track your data long term and unlock some features.\n\nUPDATE 3/1/2023\nAfter about 18 months of use, the screen went black. I tried Fitbit's customer service, which suggested either rebooting the device using the charging cable button, or installing a new clock face from the smartphone app. Neither solution worked, and that was the end of Fitbit's support. So take that as you will. This was a good device for the 18 months that it lasted, but I'm not so certain I will look to replace it with another Fitbit, rather than a competing device.",

After being addicted to fitbit pay with my charge 3 for two years, this device is so bad I now exclusively use my phone for tap to pay. In addition, all of the clock faces continue to be terrible. And the navigation is a nightmare. At least once a week due to normal movement, my watch will be on a screen that is not the time, and navigating back to the time is incredibly frustrating. Ive been actively looking for other fitness bands. After being a loyal fitbut customer for almost 6 years, this being my third watch, not including others ive purchased as gifts, I will never spend another cent on fitbit.\n\nEdit x2: Now the screen randomly decides to just stay on until it dies. It’s currently dead after having been at 100% battery less than two days ago. I don’t think I’ve ever hated a product more.\n\n—\n\nAfter 2 years of my Charge 3, it finally died on me and I upgraded to the Charge 5. Ive had it for about 2 weeks now and this watch is pretty much worse in every category compared to the charge 3.\n\n- clock faces. My charge 3 had a clock face with the time and step count. Thats all i wanted to see at a glance. There are NO options for just steps and the time. There are a lot of clock faces, but evidently they hired a graphic designer who thought he was making modern art, not an actual usable product, because roughly 10% of the clock faces are even normal.\n\n- navigation. The charge 3 had a home button along with the touch screen, so no matter where i was in the interface, i could return to the start screen with a press. And its easy to accidentally be on other screens on the charge watches because of accidental swipes. This device, sometimes you swipe to the left, sometimes down, seemingly at random, to return to the start screen.\n\n- fitbit pay. I use this all the time. You have to unlock the device to use this feature. For some reason the charge 5 slows down drastically when using this feature.\n\n- reactivity. My charge 3 always turned on when i flip my wrist to look at the time. Charge 5 probably only works 3/4 of the time, and it’s slower.\n\n- app connectivity. It frequently has issues syncing with the app. When browsing clock faces i literally get notifications every second that the watch disconnected.\n\nOverall this is an extremely disappointing product.",

Why not let us choose our goal for the 24 hour day? I want to hit 12 or 13 hours with 250+ steps it shouldn’t matter if I’m stuck in a class or meeting and can’t accomplish it for a particular hour. I should be able to make up for it at the end of the day\nThe Good: Helps keep me on track with my exercise goals. The sleep tracking is helpful for me to have a better idea of how much sleep I’m getting but isn’t always accurate as it isn’t able to distinguish when one is actually sleeping and when they’re just laying there trying to sleep. I’m still really glad I bought it. Helps me get closer to those two goals.\n\nThe Mediocre: I have to tap the watch face multiple times… sometimes 10 times to get to the info I want. I wish I could just set it up to display the two or three pieces of info that matter to me. It also came preloaded with automatic timers/reminder buzzes that drove me crazy. Thankfully my husband eventually figured out how to turn them off.\n\nThere are several other features that many will find useful: enabling them to monitor food and water intake, weight goals, blood pressure, and exercise reminders if you’ve been idle for too long.\n\nEasily & quickly charged and will hold the charge for 5-6 days.",

If you look at the Fitbit forum you will see lots of unhappy users and no help from Fitbit.\n\nWhile the device looks good and seems accurate enough for steps, if you hope to reliably synch to the app or remain connected to the iPhone via bluetooth, then good luck. None of the steps customer support recommends work for the long haul. You need to reconnect to bluetooth manually multiple times per day. In addition to this problem the heart rate will also stop working, and the fitbit must be restarted, a common complaint in the forum. Sleep tracking does not reliably work. Sometimes it will track sleep, other times it will not. See the forum.\n\nWhile a customer service rep in the forum states that the team is aware of the issues (it has been months), there is no ETA for a fix. Perhaps at some point in the future this device will be ready for sale, but if you buy now, buy it with the knowledge that you will not consistently be able to use the advertised features without lots of manual intervention, restarting the device, your phone, toggling bluetooth, repairing etc. I wish my old reliable fitbit flex didn't break.",

There is so much wrong with this device, it is hard to know where to start — but let's start with this seeming like an \"alpha\" release. Not even a \"beta\" release.\n\nIf you are used to a Fitbit battery lasting for days, get used to disappointment. This one lasts for maybe a day with the always on set to dim. The band is a Fitbit band, meaning bad and not breathable. Within days my wrist had two raw patches where water had gotten underneath and rubbed my skin raw. One \"app\" I use regularly is the Stopwatch to time how long I have been doing something. That \"app\" regularly disappeared from the Charge 5. I couldn't move off the countdown timer. I could only get the stopwatch back by resetting the device, which I never had to do before. Shutting off the vibration for the alarm, while in bed half-asleep, is an exercise in complete frustration. Almost impossible to do. Your partner won't like it either as it keeps going off. The last morning I wore it, I had to remove it in frustration and drop it off the bed. Also, I had tried to turn OFF the alarm completely the night before so it wouldn't go off at all, but despite my informed efforts, I must have missed one because it kept on going off early in the morning when I didn't want it to! Either too complicated or another software glitch.\n\nFinally, whatever you do, don't buy through Fitbit! Buy through Amazon or other retailer. My wife bought this for me at the Black Friday sale at Fitbit, but didn't give it to me until Christmas. It took me a week or so to switch over and then I used it for a couple of weeks, giving it a good trial. When she and I tried to return it, Fitbit said that a return had to be done by January 9th! I spent an hour on the phone on January 21 trying to get this clarified, but after an hour with a representative (from India?), they still couldn't tell me anything. Amazon gives customers until Jan. 31 to return Christmas items. Is Fitbit deliberately trying to lose customers? Anyway, this product failed in numerous ways and I am sorry we ever bought it. YMMV.",

Well the other day I felt like I was an AFib, and it said my results were inconclusive because my heart rate was over 120; WELL DUH?! Anyone who has AFib knows that your heart rate gets really high it occurs. The result told me my pulse was 177 BPM, but couldn't tell me whether or not I was in AFib?? What kind of crap is that?! If my post was lower than 120, I would not be in AFib. This thing is a total piece of garbage for me when it comes to checking for AFib.\n\nAs far as the sleep goes, I went to bed at midnight the other night and it said I didn't go to bed till 2:00 a.m., although it was dead nuts accurate to the very minute that I woke up. It's also splitting up my evenings and mornings. I'll wake up in the morning and it gives me one reading from yesterday, that does not give an in-depth record because I was not asleep for 3 hours before midnight. Then after midnight hits, it started over again on the different day. So one night's sleep, split up into two recordings, with the first portion of the night not being able to give you in-depth details. This is happened multiple times since I got it. Not cool. I've read where it's doing that to other people as well. They say something about resetting it, blah blah blah, but the fact of the matter is, if it's not working correctly, and has this issue, they need to fix it...as well as not even advertise the AFib portion of it; that is worthless to me.",

I feel like sleep score has nothing to do with how well I felt my sleep was. Also smart alarm will always go off 15 min before wake time regardless of my sleep stage or even if I’m already awake.\n\nZone minutes: device recognizes activity while im going to the supermarket, but zero zone minutes for HIIT workout.\n\nSupport: Spoke with support four times. Complete waste of time. Kept telling me to do factory reset, reinstalled app. Nothing really worked.\n\nBottom line: returned the watch and got a different brand instead",

This is of course with a manual screen turn-on function and medium brightness, truly just sad battery life. Other than that, it seems to be an adequate all-in-one fitness tracker.

I bought it mostly for heart rate monitoring while bicycling, and that seems to work well. But I really wanted it to seamlessly integrate with Strava app, and that is still disappointing.\n\nI learned to be comfortable with it on my wrist. The first week was rather uncomfortable; now I hardly notice it. Except for the battery percentage, the screens are readable, and you'll learn what all the swiping left, right, up, and down, does.\n\nMine still has some issues:\nUPDATE (2/5/22): Step counter works better if you're walking and swinging your arms normally. If you are carrying something (or looking at the watch) or gripping a handrail or walker or pushing a stroller, etc., you aren't going to get accurate steps. Syncing issues continue; GPS connectivity is still unreliable.\n\n1) battery indicator on iphone app no longer registers correctly. Tiny greyed-out battery percentage indicator on the Charge is more accurate but is nearly invisible without a magnifying glass.\n\n2) my device can't maintain bluetooth connection to iPhone app. This makes syncing difficult and time-consuming. Even after turning on/off bluetooth and restarting device.\n\n3) integration with Strava for exercise (biking) is confusing and weak. Sometimes, when using \"phone\" setting for GPS, recording works great; other times it drops out (even over the same route where it worked the day before). So I have to activate Strava as a back-up, sometimes ending up with \"duplicate\" activities if Fitbit works. Just delete the Strava activity if the Fitbit one works, you say? They're not really duplicates though: Strava data is much more accurate than Fitbit, but Fitbit provides the heart rate, which is why I bought it. So I lose something if I delete either one. But if I keep both, it shows inaccurate record of my exercise activity. Grrr.\n\nIf I set my device for Built-in GPS, I'm not dependent on the phone, but the battery runs down very quickly, so it has to be fully charged before a ride of more than a couple of hours. And even then, the GPS distance measure is unreliable.",

A 10 minute seated presentation at work yielded another 300 steps. I'll routinely wake up from a night's sleep with 100 steps or so already logged (after not getting up in the night at all). All these together, I'm logging around 3,000 or so \"steps\" per day doing mundane activities where I'm not actually moving at all.\n\nIn addition to that, the calorie tracker is absurdly off. Maybe by as much as 30-40%. The charge 5 noted that a favorite walk of mine at 3.18 miles burned 778 calories. That's CRAZY and no where near accurate. It has repeatedly done this for walking, treadmill, and weightlifting activities. It's not even close to accurate.\n\nI had no expectations that this product would be perfectly accurate, but I also didn't expect the device to be completely inaccurate, either. I use it only to see if I'm trending towards being active for the day, or if I'm trending towards burning more calories.

It’s very comfortable (once you get a new band lol) and to the point because it’s smaller I honestly don’t feel it as much as I did the Versa 1. It does pretty much the same stuff except for the readiness thing which I thought was cool (gotta wear it for 4 days to get results first though ) cause it would (in theory) help motivate me to go to the gym more and know if I should do a long session or not ^^ kind of like your own little cheer leader !

But if it's been more than a minute, your odds are more like 50/50 that it will actually wake the device, and they go downhill the longer the device has been idle.

Also there are many options for the clock face but not really good ones. I like the analog style but there are only 2 options and they are hard to read. Not thrilled. I’m not sure I’d recommend this one. The good news is, it charges very quickly but you still have to keep good track because like I said, you have to charge it every couple of days. I would use more of the options I think if it didn’t run the battery down so quickly. So all in all it’s ok but not fabulous in my opinion.",

It came in one day, and kept time and counted steps, but nothing else worked because the heart rate monitor did not function (no green light on back either). Amazon replaced it within 6 hours, and the replacement was the same! No heart monitor.\nI contacted FitBit customer service and after a few minutes was connected to someone with such a heavy accent that we could barely communicate, who ran through a checklist to make sure that it wasn’t something I was doing. No success, because the heart rate monitor simply does not function, and almost all of the functions run off of the heart rate monitor.\nShe “elevated” my situation to the next level of service, who was supposed to contact me by email. It has been a week and nothing.\nI did some internet research and found that this is a common problem and that many, perhaps most, perhaps all Charge 5 watches have the same problem - probably a software update glitch they can’t fix.\nBottom line: The watches don’t work and FitBit customer service is nonexistent.\nI guess I’ll return the replacement to Amazon, forget about FitBit and go find a quality fitness watch from a different company. I would suggest that you skip the hours of frustrating hassle and simply buy some other product to begin with.\n(If you don’t believe me, go ahead and Google “Why doesn’t my Charge 5 heart monitor work?” yourself).",

        "text": "Bought this for my father thinking the he needed something simpler and less expensive than a Garmin fitness watch (I have used a Garmin watch for a decade) and because the App from Fitbit looks simple and insightful. First things first. It took me a few hours (in a span of two days) to install and upgrade the watch (with an Android phone) and get it going in my dad's wrist. The watch band by the way, it has some creativity in its design, once in place it is very confortable to wear. The big if is that my dad is not used to it and so he struggle the few times he tried himself to wear the watch. Although as I said the band is confortable I wonder why in something so important Fitbit decided to try something new. In terms of the screen and the info, if one is new to Fitbit it takes time to understand the icons and stats the watch delivers and the sweeps needed to get a full read of all the stats. One appeal for me of the reasons I chose the watch was this information. What I noticed for my dad is that he needed quite a bit of time to be able to extract the information from the watch as my dad kept sweeping the screen many times without success and so the first two days he used it he seemed frustrated. My thinking, like everything else is that this is about getting used to it, and a big positive of extracting in this way the info from the watch is the battery life one can get from the device.\n\nMy biggest couple of negatives of the device. While setting up the watch and the App (I used the watch myself to do this) , the app asked me if I wanted to hire the premium service. This I found it frustrating if you are new to the watch, when you have not had the time to see the full functionality of the watch. This is not very important, but still I remember filling somewhat frustrated by it. The second point is that in the second day of usage the screen turned unresponsive. There is a relatively quick fix for this if one googles the problem. By connecting the device to an outlet, and pushing a bottom three times, voila the watch resets. That showed me quickly that the watch was not for my dad, he would not understand why a new device would have that failure. In summary, the watch has some interesting futures, it is nice to the eye, but is is cumbersome to use and impractical. I returned the item and decided for a more expensive Garmin watch that I know much better, and specially its reliability and easiness of use.",

(Google \"Tattoogate\" lol)\n\nThat being said, once I discovered this issue, I purchased it a third time, equipped the Charge 5 to my dominant, NON-TATTOOED WRIST and viola! Everything worked!\n\nI really do enjoy this model, despite some bad press it has received and I was almost dead set to toss the entire company into the trashcan before learning about this really, really, obscure \"disclaimer\". I will note that I never saw any sort of warnings in the pamphlet, and had it not been for that one user asking in the fitbit forum if that might be the issue, I would have never known. So I pass it along to those who also might believe they got a lemon......multiple times in a row, like myself. LOL",

All the many troubleshooting recommendations on the Fitbit website make no difference whatsoever. If I had read the many reviews that discuss the same problems, I would not have bought it.

I've had it come undone multiple times at different times doing different things. It just doesn't have a good clasp that is reliable. Thankfully the times it's come undone I've been quick enough to catch it and save it from dropping to the ground. I would not buy again due to the constant unexpected times it has come off. The band seems to becoming worse as time goes on with it coming disconnected. Just the lightest push from the top side and boom it's off. Just putting on a jacket or even long sleeve shirt can catch it just right and off it comes. So frustrated with the poor design.",

        "text": "I've been using Fitbit since the Charge 2, mostly to track my sleep and resting heart rate.\n\nThe first and biggest complaint is that the Charge 5 has no physical button. This means you have to navigate between the different applications using swipes that often do not register, with no easy way to back out of an app that you tapped on by mistake. This is especially frustrating if you want to monitor your metrics mid-exercise. Making matters worse, you can only see a single metric at a time (for running there's like 9 total). The Charge 5 has the biggest screen yet, but manages to fit very little information on screen at a time; the enormous bezel was not a good design choice in this context, but that's not nearly as bad as the fact that there's no physical button to quickly \"go home\" anymore.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to buy this device was the much-awaited Smart Wake feature. Sure enough the smart alarm worked for the first two days of use (though the swipe up to cancel, swipe down to snooze feature is not at all intuitive--again, a good use case for the absent button). However, by the third day I noticed that the alarm was no longer waking me. I've tried deleting my alarms, restarting my device, setting up new alarms then syncing the device. No luck. It's not because the motor is dead either, as the tracker still vibrates when I reach my daily step goal.\n\nFinally, my computer is unable to sync with my Charge 5. I've been using the Fitbit Windows app to sync my trackers for years. The first time I tried to sync, the Windows app asked me to un-pair and re-pair my tracker, which I did, and it was able to sync. Since that first sync, my tracker has been unable to sync over Windows. I'm still able to sync over Android, but that application requires location to be enabled *at all times* (not just when the app is open) or it will refuse to let you access the dashboard. Not a good look when the device pairs over Bluetooth.\n\nI will be returning this device and going back to my old charge 4. There's no reason, as far as I can tell, to use this tracker.",

I often get my 10,000 steps notification when I'm sitting down, not even moving. From what I've seen, it seems to be up to 30% off at times, often overcounting.\n\nThe Charge 5's heart rate tracking is even worse than the step counter. I workout five times a week, and row three times a week, every time with the Polar H10, which is arguably considered the benchmark in heart rate monitors. The Charge 5 can't track the upper-end zones, which for me is 150–175. It seems the Charge 5 can't track anything above 140-ish. I work out so much, I can tell when I'm at my max, but the Charge 5 will give low, inaccurate readings. As well, it buzzes constantly during a workout if you've chosen the \"workout\" setting. The \"weight training\" setting is much less intrusive. However, regardless of the workout you've chosen, you have to tell it to stop, then finish, the scroll down and tap done to complete it and get back to the standard watch face. Seriously, Fitbit?\n\nThat brings me to the ECG feature. Considering it can't track my heart rate accurately during a workout, I can't imagine it would be able to give reliable information regarding a-fibrillation. I wish this wasn't true, as it was a buying point for me.\n\nAnother disappointment is the lack of different watch faces. I knew this before getting it, but it's worth mentioning for those who might like a wide choice or variation in this department.\n\nNext on the list is the app. I don't allow it to use location services, which it annoyingly reminds me of every single time I open the app. It's also incredibly slow to sync with the device, often taking upwards of a minute to do. I can't imagine 24 hours of data should take that long, but it does.\n\nAll in all, this thing's an overpriced toy.

It communicates and syncs with the phone just fine. Can't see anything on the FItBit itself though. Mine and my wifes did that in the span of a couple weeks... Hmm Google are you trying to have users upgrade sooner?? I already switched to an Apple Watch, my wife will use the new Versa for now... but if that goes, No more FitBits in the family. We have(had) 4 of them.",

I am not a person who likes call and message notifications on his tracker, so I was accustomed to about 7 days of battery life from these. I have my phone on me all the time and with ever-worsening reading vision, I couldn't read any of the previous FitBit screens for anything other than time, anyway. The Charge 5 is different. I can tell pretty much what's going on with my steps/heart rate/calories burned on the standard watchface in any light. It's a big positive.\nTwo frustrations, though: First, the water lock should not be buried beyond the payment tile and whatever other tiles it's buried behind. If you shower every day, you will need the water lock every day. I did not have this problem with any other fitbit, but this one goes off to all corners of the menu if you don't water lock it in the shower. God help you if you do have payments set up. Second, if you like notifications for your workouts, beware. I went on a 4.5-hour canoe trip and this tracker burned itself out with the HR zone notifications. So I got about 3/4 of my trip tracked and arrived home with a dead tracker. I have since turned those off, but I haven't taken on another trip of that length since to see how it handles the ups and downs.\nIt would also be nice if paddling was one of the auto-recognized exercises, but it is not. It did, however, attempt to take my \"outdoor workout\" paddle and convert it into a swim. It must have recognized its error when I unchecked swimming as an auto-recognized exercise. Nothing like having a 15-mile paddle converted into yards and laps. I just shook my head.\nIf you're not familiar with Fitbit's culture, they have the same annoyingly useless help system as Roku: Post your question in the forums and hope someone with half a brain or a company title can help you out. That's not a \"knowledge base,\" it's chaos and it's laughable. Hopefully you don't have any issues.\nAll told, it's a nice tracker, but it's got a surprising amount counter-intuitive hiccups for the 5th iteration. It was a gift or I'd probably be back to the Alta HR after watching the Charge 3 screen die mysteriously not once but twice. Hopefully this one stays alive longer.\nEDIT: This thing just finds new ways to disappoint. My workouts are wildly inaccurate vs. previous Fitbits and the battery burns through the last 10 percent in about an hour. With everything turned off, I get about 5.5 days of battery life.",

The Charge 5 feels comfortable on my wrist and the band although not my choice, seems good enough with a softer strap. I plan to update after a week or so. Right now battery life seems to be going well with 90% after 24 hours.\n\nUpdate 5 days of ownership. I forgot to mention in my initial review that it did take extra effort to pair and sync with my iPhone 11. Success was achieved only after resetting Bluetooth on my phone and reinstalling the app. All seems to be working favorably. I really like the speed of sync and reliability of the Bluetooth connection compared to my Charge 3. Battery is at 62%. I have not use the gps feature yet. I think this will be a keeper. Very easy to find info on the tracker and the app is helpful compiling the data. Recommended.\n\nUpdate 8 days: Battery still has 24% after 8 days. Not using gps. Still like this device very much. Great being able to track sleep, HR, steps, activity, mindfulness and readiness with App. Just placed on charger 45 minutes ago, now back to 93% charge. Excellent!\n\nUpdate: 12 days, There has been a change in the rate of battery duration. Two things happened that may have impacted this. 1) I used the gps feature by selecting bicycle exercise. Normally I would not use the watch for this purpose as I have a Garmin computer on my bike but I was curious on how this might work. After a two hour bike ride more than 40% of the battery charge was consumed. It also lacks an auto pause feature like my Garmin has so it also counted a coffee stop as cycling reducing my average speed from 14 mph to only 8 mph.. Additionally, I also started the premium feature. I fully charged the watch this am at 8am (100% charge) and now at 3 pm it is at 80%. Bottom line, the less features you use the more battery time between charges. Still better than an Apple Watch.\n\nUpdate 1-5-22. There are problems with rapid battery power loss. You should check out the Fitbit Community and review for the Charge 5. It maybe dependent on manufacturing location. The one I purchased here on Amazon was made in Malaysia. Others who got a Charge 5 made in China are having battery issues. Fitbit Will make suggestions to resolve these issues but for some, these approaches do not work. Beware that some are only getting 1-2 days out of a battery charge while others have documented getting up to 8 days. Fitbit is offering replacement for those who cannot resolve their battery issues but the replacement could be a remanufactured unit that is warranted for only 3 months.",

        "text": "Wristband:\nMy main problem with the Charge 5 is that both of the wristbands provided don't stay attached to their connection to the watch face. I'll just be walking around the grocery store, getting out of my car, or sitting at the dinner table and feel my watch fall of my arm because it will not stay attached. I'm afraid to work out in the thing for fear of losing it on the trail! I had a similar problem with the Charge 2, but it wasn't as bad. This makes me think it's a design issue with FitBit and is really making me wary of buying another one. The bands for the Charge 2 would also just break, but I haven't had the Charge 5 long enough to see how the band material holds up.\n\nWatch Interface:\nThe interface on the Charge 5 feels clunkier than the Charge 2. I feel like I have to scroll forever to just say I'm on a walk, and I have to do a couple taps to even see my steps. The watch is bright and sleek looking, but it just doesn't seem super easy to use. I'm also disappointed that they got rid of the number of stairs climbed.\n\nSync issues:\nIt took several attempts to get the Charge 5 to sync with my phone initially. A few days later, I had not worn the Charge 5 for a few hours, and it took a handful of attempts to get it to sync. I occasionally had issues with syncing with the Charge 2 as well. It seemed to be more of a problem if I went a period without wearing or syncing it, but it was still very frustrating at times. I don't know if the FitBit software is bad or what.",

After getting a \"normal\" result, I don't know what to do with it anymore.\n* Swiping-based interface is a bit annoying, but it's bearable.\n* I wish vibration could be stronger.

I decided to purchase this device because I wanted to understand what data my patients are sharing with me on a regular basis.\nThe heart rate variability and sleep scores were decent but I am not a fan of someone else taking this information and telling me how well I'm doing or not doing without some input from myself or very solid research behind it. I think this tool is great for someone who is looking for ways to get started on their activity levels and become more in tune with their body. So my review might just be for a product which wasn't targeted at me. It wasn't hard to wear it but raising your wrist to see the time worked maybe 20% of the time. Tapping the screen to see the different windows was painful and when you get into the shower the thing goes crazy and asks you to activate the water lock which you can't because it's going crazy. The battery seems to last about a week which is okay. The credit card feature is borderline absurd because you have to enter a pin every time you want to use it which requires so many screen taps that it would be something you'd have to spend a few minutes on before even scanning your phone. The app is pretty basic and there isn't a way to manipulate your data on the app or create your own custom graphs and see how your mood and activity level correlates with your sleep etc. Or at least I couldn't figure it out. To boot, when I tried to return it to fitbit it was a 1 hour ordeal of searching for a return address, failing to have the \"return tool\" recognize my zip code and order ID and then having to open a chat and somehow not being able to make it clear to the customer service person (who was actually very friendly) that I just wanted a shipping return address. So I had to give him all my information just to get the return approved. If I can buy it with 3 clicks on the Fitbit website I'd like to return it with no more than 3 clicks. I'm disappointed in the product, the promise, and the service. But I can think of a place for such products for my patients but I would experiment with others before recommending fitbit.",

        "text": "I've used other devices to track my fitness/health and I really thought that the Charge 5 was going to be the answer. I did research on various brand devices through various sources. The Fitbit gets great ratings.\n\nI'm disappointed. I've been using it faithfully for about 3 weeks now. I'm of the opinion that it just may be buggy, and a future firmware update can improve it in many ways, hence the overall three-star rating. The Premium service is hype and doesn't seem that it is worth the money, so I'm debating if I will subscribe once the free period expires.\n\nWhen I'm walking the actual steps are fewer than what the Fitbit reports, When I'm doing my cardio, while my heart rate is steady, the Fitbit continually reports inaccurate reading, usually much lower than the actual heartbeat and at times showing peak heart rates. It does this inconsistently like it operates on a sliding scale. Different location placement of the Fitbit on either arm makes no difference. Also, I have programed the high/low settings for notification, which I have exceeded, the Fitbit for some reason has not warned/notified/signaled or whatever it is supposed to do.\n\nIt does an excellent job accurately displaying my heart rhythm for the 30 second period when I do an ECG. It does report when I'm experiencing Atrial fabulation. However, unlike many of the other features, it doesn't record for record the readings. It does a good job in tracking my resting heart rate.\n\nI'm not impressed with the Sp02 percentage process. It only does an average during sleep. It doesn't provide data as to levels during the period that it monitors. The ECG, the Sp02% should have a feature like the ECG so I can manually check my oxygen level when desired.",

I had no idea how many calories I was burning in my workouts and was stunned to find out that a 30 minute brisk walk only burns about 200 calories. Now that I can hone in how many calories I’m burning in a day, I can tailor my diet accordingly and I’ve finally started to lose some weight.\n\nI love all the visual options, all the stats available in the app. My one complaint is it does VERY FAST when using GPS. I tried to use it on a long day hike, it died halfway through. So if you want to track hikes instead of runs, I’d get a garmin (my husbands garmin lasts much longer for the rugged activities).

There are also some things like floor counters that are no longer included (and sadly missed), and I have to reset the watch at least once per week. Several of the apps are extremely buggy. All-in-all, the color screen and brightness controls are the only reasons I didn't return this device initially, but now I just want to throw it away - what a piece of garbage.\n\nThe biggest problem with the device is that there is no longer any button to use - the apps all depend on gestures such as swipes, taps, and double-taps. Unfortunately, the quality control for the apps is ridiculous and I have found a few errors that are merely annoying, but several others are deal-breakers.\n\nScreen display does not come on automatically when I raise my wrist - even though that setting is enabled. I must tap the screen 3 times to find out the time.\n\nThe clock face cannot be updated - I get a bogus error that says I am not connected to the internet - yet here we are - typing a message on the internet. There is a lot of discussion on the internet as to how to get around this, but most of the suggestions involve removing ad-blockers and other security features.\n\nThe Timers app has 2 different functions: Count-down timer and stopwatch. Unfortunately, my watch is frequently stuck on the count-down timer and I have to reset the watch 2 or 3 times in order to get the timers menu to re-appear. It's currently stuck on a 15-minute timer that I set a couple of weeks ago and I cannot access the stopwatch.\n\nThe stopwatch - if the timer menu gods are allowing it to be used - is buggy. Starting the timer immediately shows the pause icon so that you can stop it, but the display doesn't change the digits from 0 for several seconds. It might show the 0 for 8 seconds and then change the display to an 8 - which then freezes for maybe 5-11 seconds and then the display is updated. Isn't a simple stopwatch something that the Fitbit engineers can code? Apparently not.\n\nI've uploaded a video showing how buggy the Exercise app is. The video shows the app's limited range. I can scroll down to choose an exercise, or I can scroll to the right - which will either show a black screen or it will show the buggy Stopwatch app. I am trapped in this app and nothing will allow me to get back to the main screen - or anything else. If the device had a button, I could force it to reset, but no such luck. What a steaming pile of software.\n\nIf you've read this far and are still considering buying this piece of garbage, my condolences.\n\nFitbit really created a loser product with this one. No wonder the price has been dropped.\n\nI hope that the Charge 6 fixes at least a few of these issues, but that's doubtful.

        "text": "I used the original Fitbit Inspire for about a year before upgrading to the Inspire 2.  I was very pleased with the upgraded model, which added some new features, improved on existing features, and improved my battery life from about 8 days to 12 days. About six months later, I upgraded again to the Luxe model. Sadly, I am left somewhat disappointed.  The Luxe is a great product overall, but there are a few things about it which seem to be downgrades from the previous model (Inspire 2).  After using the Luxe for only a couple of months, I upgraded to this Charge 5 model.\n\nThis review will compare and contrast the models I've used.\n\nWhen I switched from Inspire 2 to Luxe, there were some changes that I loved. It goes without saying that the Luxe display is far superior to the Inspire 2.  The Luxe display is crisp, clear, and full color.  I also like the thinner band on the Luxe.  I didn't mind the band on the Inspire 2, but the Luxe band is definitely more feminine (although if I were a guy, I would probably prefer the Inspire 2 band).  With the Charge 5 model, the screen is even better than the Luxe; however, the band and screen are much larger. This is PERFECT for a man. I am a woman with a very small wrist and I feel like it is slightly too large for my frame. Overall, I prefer the size of the Luxe.\n\nWhat changes do I not love?  The display on the Luxe and Charge 5 models is activated by touching the screen.  It is finicky.  Sometimes it turns on randomly from movement (you'll see an example of this in the video I attached).  Other times, I have to tap on it two or three times before the display activates.  This is a HUGE downgrade from the Inspire 2, which turned on by pressing the side of the band.  It worked every time and never turned on randomly when I didn't want it to light up. \n\nThe biggest reason why I disliked the Luxe is the battery life.  It is estimated at only 6 days, which is even worse than the original Inspire.  In practice, it only lasted THREE days. The Charge seems to be an improvement, as I'm getting five to six days of battery life on this model.\n\nThe Charge 5 sells for $179. The Luxe sells for $150 - $200 depending on the band that you select.  The Inspire 2 sells for $80 and is frequently on sale for less.  I honestly don't believe the Luxe is worth the difference in price over the Inspire.  If I was in the market for a new Fitbit and didn't have unlimited funds, I would opt for the Inspire 2. If I had the funds to splurge a bit, I'd order the Charge 5.",

When I got the 5 however, I quickly decided to return it and get a new Charge 4 instead before the latter was no longer available in stores. I did this for the following reasons:\n\n- Floors are no longer tracked because there is no altimeter in the Charge 5. (The Charge 2, 3, and 4 all have one and can track floors.)\n\n- The Charge 5 would constantly have problems syncing with the app and give errors when I tried to change the clock face.\n\n- The blood-oxygen metrics are only recorded during sleep. There was nothing on the Fitbit website that indicated this at the time of purchase so I assumed incorrectly that you can do a blood-oxygen reading at any time.\n\n- The heart ECG functionality was not available at the time of release. It really feels like Fitbit released the tracker before the software and other features were ready.\n\n- You cannot set alarms in the app like you could with the Charge 2. The Charge 5 only lets you do so on the tracker itself. (I am not sure about the Charge 3.) This is too bad because it’s way easier to use the app to set alarms than the much smaller tracker screen. To be fair, the Charge 4 also forces you to set the alarms on the tracker.\n\nI really wanted to love the Charge 5, but for the reasons above and more, I just had to return it.",

There are few things I like about, such as minimal look and the sensors to count steps, track sleep, heart beat and ability to add other apps to work with it.\n\nHowever, the cons are many after using this over three weeks. Firstly, there are some features that are currently unavailable, not sure why one would sell the product that is half baked. Like most the value depreciates over time and new models (with better tech) arrive every year, this watch is pay the premium now and get the features later. Secondly, the watch collects all information like sleep pattern, continuous heart beat rate, oxygen levels etc... however fibit want to show this data only if you subscribe for premium membership which costs 8 bucks a month or 80 per year. I understand the premium membership comes with added value like more health activities etc... which is unarguably fine, value added service with premium membership but withholding my data that has been collected by the watch is by no reason acceptable.\n\nThere is much personal data that is scraped by using this watch but it will be accessible fully only with membership. At the price point of 180 dollars, I expect to own both watch and the data it generates. If not the actual cost to own this fitbit is 180+80 = $260 (first year and $80 for consecutive years) if you use for 5 years, cost to own watch (and data) = $580. At this price tag I better look elsewhere.",

I haven't used the fitbit app in a while but was surprised there are so many \"premium\" only features (many of which are \"coming soon\"). So in addition to buying the device, you have to get a premium subscription to get all the bells and whistles. The battery claims to last up to a week, and definitely falls short of that in my time using it. One of the things I disliked the most about the charge 2 was the lack of GPS. This indicated that there was built in GPS (instead of relying on a paired phone), but frankly, I'm just not seeing it. If I leave my phone at home, the GPS is very glitchy. The screens are clumsy to navigate, and the ambient light mode is a total fail.

Which is misleading because it states you can wear it in the pool and it has a swimming \"function\" in the app, you just can't access it. It does water lock for the pool, but that is it (even though turning on this function is tricky). The touch sensitivity is sub par, and having no button, sometimes the watch isn't responsive, especially if you have sweaty or wet fingers. The batter life is amazing though, I'll give them that. For the price, I did expect more though. Replacement straps are unreasonably expensive. And for some reason, you cannot have military time on the display. However, you could on the older models. I had the HR 2 before this, and it was easier to use. Given the amount of time and iterations that have passed since then, I was hoping that they would have improved the product more. Feels like this model is an \"alpha\" and we're supposed to work out the bugs from it. The app often thinks I'm offline too, and won't sync. Even though I'm on wifi and my phone is literally next to my watch. I'm giving it a 3 because of the batter life.\n\nSome more cons are that when you are on a call, the watch is useless. It shows that you're on a call and you cannot use any of its functionality. That seems like a pretty significant design flaw. And to clear a notification, you need several steps, and because touch isn't responsive, can end up doing things you didn't want to (like marking a message read, even though you didn't intend to, or ending a call, even though you didn't want to). If this were any other brand, for the price I paid, I'd give it a 2 or even 1 star. But I like Fitbit and have been pleased with their other products, so they get a 3 in the hopes that they improve the next model, and make it a more reasonable price point.",

I have in my possession a Charge 3 which actually works very well, but I finally decided to treat myself and step up to a Charge 5. Big mistake.\n\nMy experience is that several of the wrist alarms that I have set sometimes just mysteriously disappear. The EDA scan worked once and has never worked again; the sleep scanner is often inaccurate and the GPS is variable in its accuracy. Trying to do something as simple as put the tracker on my wrist and buckle the strap may take several minutes, because some idiot designed the strap to only be insertef under everything else next to the skin, where it does not slide well because of the pressure on it from the overlying strap. The clasp knob may or may not hold the strap itself.\n\nThe Charge 3 was actually a far more dependable tracker device; since I still have it I will probably switch back to it and either give the Charge 5 away or return it to Amazon.\n\nThe only thing that Charge 5 does better than Charge 3 is in being fully waterproof and having a color screen, but that's about it. It is a buggy device, difficult to navigate, difficult even to strap on. I would not recommend this device as a gift for oneself or for others.\n\nNov. 4, 2021 software is so buggy one never knows what will happen; as an example today I got suddenly a burst of notifications I didn't want so I was totally unable to find out what time is was. No matter how many taps, notifications continued. Obviously this tracker was released way before it was ready, with no hope of an upgrade in sight. Even basic functions don't work except with erratic readings. The only thing that really works is that it does tell the correct time/date; other than that, everything else is buggy or absent.",

Let me tell you about those first.\n\nDislikes:\n-The strap is a magnet for lint/dust and things of that nature. In my pictures you can see lint or dust on my strap and that was after I tried to clean it off with a microfiber cloth. Things just stick to it really well.\n-The strap doesn't fit perfect. There's not enough adjustment points on the strap to fit my wrist just perfect. One hole it's too loose then the next hole makes it too tight. This will be different for everyone but this is the issue I've run in to.\n\nLikes:\n-It has tons of health metrics including heart rate 24/7, track you SpO2 (although it's not something you can check on demand, it will give you your Sp02 once a day. And you do have to wear it to bed)\n-It has built in GPS. This is so nice having on the Charge 5 because it means you don't have to carry your phone with you while your exercising. Without your phone you can view real time pace and distance and when you get back to your phone you can view a map of your run/walk in the Fitbit app.\n-The color screen is vibrant and it reacts to your touch without hesitation. No problems seeing the screen it the bright sun.\n-ECG - They haven't released it yet for the Charge 5 but it will be great to have when they do.\n-Battery life. Fitbit says it'll last up to 7 days on a charge and it's totally possible. I've used the built in GPS a few times on one charge and I've gotten up to 5 days.\n\nI'm really quite happy with the Fitbit Charge 5 and I think you would be too. Not only does it do so many things for you but it looks good too.",

The bad.. hopefully this can get fixed but for now it lacks a little in the software department. There are plenty of faces on the watch but it doesn’t let you customize colors. If you like a face but don’t like the color scheme you are screwed. The lack of apps is a downer. It is great at being a tracker but I just wanted a little more from it. The removal of the weather app was something I didn’t like. I wasn’t happy that I couldn’t customize what I can see on the main face. I like to have the heart rate and calories changing but I have to go on another screen to see them. Finally the app is always reliable but I have noticed since I switched this new tracker has problems syncing VERY often.\n\nI lost my charge 4 goofing off in a river so I justified the purchase of the 5. So far there isn’t much of a software update that has made me happy about the purchase. The hardware does make it worth it so hopefully these bugs and customer needs can get fulfilled.

I stopped, cleaned both my hand and watch from the sweat and wore a band to absorb the rest, however the Charge did not see more than 133bpms after that.

The biggest problem I have seen is slow times with downloading the data to the app. The Fitbit app will also take up a lot of space on your phone, and the functions inside the app can be laggy. The app does including the watch faces, but they need to sent to the charge 5, they are not stored on it. The things I like were the extra apps too, in my older one, like the weather, but this one is not the same. However, this battery does last longer, and the sensor tracking is much better. The best part of the Charge 5 is the magnetic charger, its so much easier to use. The screen display is also amazing, very clear and crisp features. The new measure is ok, you can use the heart rate still, and its accurate. I think the 6 month trial is a fantastic offer, it gives you enough time to try out different options. The fit bit pay, I have not used. The app itself provides very detailed information and is extremely helpful in navigating health.

        "text": "I had a Charge 3 and decided to upgrade despite the charge 3 working fine. I had an inspire HR briefly before the Charge 3, which I miss for it's size and simplicity.\n\nImmediately I noticed the Charge 5 has a color screen, and the built-in GPS and clock faces are a nice touch. Although, I bought my charge 3 on sale for $120, so the $180 price was hard to swallow.\n\nPROS:\n+ The band is flexible (but feels more cheap) than the previous charge 3 band.\n+ The screen is 2x as bright as the charge 3, you can actually see this in daylight now.\n+ Color screen\n+ Easy to use apps and functionality\n+ Water resistant, no problems in the shower\n+ They ditched the side button from the charge in favor of all touchscreen functions. This button often went off randomly on my wrist.\n+ The wrist flipping detection is MUCH better, still not perfect, but definitely better. (when you flip your wrist to look at the screen)\n+ I got 4-7 days of battery life, depending if I was using GPS on my bike rides or working. (If you sit around a lot, you'll get closer to 7, if you heavily use it, you'll get less). You can extend battery life in a few ways, there's also an always on display that will severely drain battery, I kept it off.\n+ Fitbit app is always easy to use.\n+ Text messages work perfectly with my pixel 4a\n\nCONS:\n- The price, I think the watch is overpriced, especially compared to the competition\n- Charge 5 specific charger, which is super short and annoying to use, it's magnetic but it's so short I can't put it anywhere as it hangs from my outlet. It also requires a USB charger. (I have an anker 3 port)\n- Charge 5 specific bands\n- GPS can be slightly inaccurate, and can outright not work if you have the watch tight on your wrist\n- Weather app is gone, which is unfortunate.\n- Like most fitbits, it will drain your phone's battery faster at idle, since it's constantly syncing and connecting to bluetooth\n- The fitbit app has been the same for years without much change, still no dark mode and not much that's new, sometimes it's slow to sync.\n- Fitbit premium is stupid, but 6 months is included with this watch. Why have a subscription with an already expensive product line?\n- Fitbit watches have been known to cause allergic reactions, which I have a nickel allergy, fortunately the watch doesn't affect me.\n\nRemember, like all technology, it can help or hurt you. Decide that with fitness trackers or watches. They are a data mine for companies, however, I use it to track my calories/diet, exercise, hit goals and targets, etc. Which helps me control my weight and improve/target my fitness. I also like having a digital watch in general, I mainly use the exercise function for bike riding which it works fine. I can not comment on other exercise functions, to which there are many.",

        "text": "The Fitbit Charge 5 display is so much better than previous versions. ECG/EKG is not available yet. Fine. I think it will only tell you if you have AFib anyway, but we'll see in a few months. With all of the room on the screen with the ability to slide down on a screen, I'm not sure why the battery percentage needs to be written so small that I ned to use my phone lense to blow it up to see my remaining Fitbit battery level (thankfully the battery level is also in the app too but, again, why so minuscule on the Fitbit?). I've gone four full days and have 53% remaining (with always on display disabled and GPS in \"dynamic\" so it uses my phone GPS when available). I'm hoping it gives me a full week so that I can have a routine to charge once a week and at the same day/time each week.\nOK.......the real reason I'm writing this: Apparently like many others, I had a struggle getting the Fitbit to pair to the phone via Bluetooth after entering the four digit code that the Fitbit provides you. The Fitbit would eventually say \"Try again\" time and time again. I eventually followed a YouTube video that gave various steps to attempt to pair (i.e., restart the Fitbit Charge 5 using the little reset button on the \"USB end\" of wire which I had never seen before on any USB plug, restart the phone, turn off/on phone Bluetooth, turn on/off phone Airplane mode, hard close/open the Fitbit app, etc.). None of these steps worked. However, one of the last was steps to try was to disconnect your previous Fitbit from Bluetooth on your phone (using the phone Bluetooth settings) before pairing the new Fitbit and then, boom, success! The following steps that I, thankfully, didn't need to try were uninstalling the Fitbit app and possibly factory resets of phones and/or apps (never a fun option and to be avoided at all costs in my opinion).\nI haven't tried all the new \"mindfullness\" features, etc. on my new Fiitbit but, at least I can, once again, get a Fitbit vibration when I get a phone call, see my heart rate, see my sleep hours, and even tell what time it is when I am outside in the sunlight!",

I took one star off my rating for the archaic band that ships with the watch and the charger that is held in place with a weak magnet. The original watch band has a post that goes through a hole in the band and then tucks back under on the inside of the band against your skin. I found the process of attaching the band more difficult and time consuming than any other watch band I have used. I replaced it with another Fitbit band with a conventional holes and finger process and it is fine now. The charger is held in place by a not real strong magnet, there is nothing wrapping around the side of the watch to hold the charger in the correct spot. When you put the watch down with the charger attached or bump it, the charger can move of the contacts while still being attached to the back of the watch. When you come back an hour and half later you find the watch did not charge. I am being critical of accessories, all the engineering went into the watch and they missed some of the basics.",

The first was dead on arrival with the black screen issue discussed extensively in other reviews and on Fitbit's forums. After far too many hours diagnosing and troubleshooting it with Fitbit I exchanged the product with Amazon. The second watch was technically functional, but suffered from severe measurement accuracy issues and general sluggishness. It was regularly up to 55 bpm (!!!!) off from other devices, including other Fitbits. I tried several positions and tightness levels without improvement. With that kind of accuracy, I'd be better off feeling my pulses for a few seconds and making an estimation that way...\n\nThe form of the product is excellent however. It fits comfortably and the band material felt good. Perhaps with enough testing, Fitbit may be able to update the software enough to make this a functional product to fit its superb form.\n\nThis product was clearly not ready for release from my perspective, and I have no interest in acting as Fitbit's test development team.",

Everything else is working great.\n2/14/2022\n\nAmazon replaced the Charge 5. 10/26/2021.\nI am hoping all is well now. I still love the features and product. However, Fitbit Customer support is atrocious unlike the amazing customer service from Amazon. .\n\n11/01/2021 Update.\nThe new tracker still can't track distance accurately. I am not sure if it is due to the forested mountain trail or my jacket & gloves covering the tracker or a combination. The distance is off by 2 miles reporting 6+ to 7+ miles on a four mile trail. Otherwise it seems to be fine. I might as well just accept things as they are. But if you are a hiker and want to get accurate information about your hike, better hike in open dessert in the summer. Disappointed!\n*********\nI am very; active hiking and resistance training. (Weights). The old trackers did fairly well counting my steps during my hikes. But were close to worthless when it came to my weight training or even doing abdominal's. The charge 5 tracks everything.\nThe screen is so easy to read. Very simple to navigate through all the modes.\nI am very pleased with it.\nBut only had it a few days, so time will tell.\n\n2 weeks later....\n\nI still love the features but the device is full of glitches. I assume software glitches.\nI hike the exact same trail up the mountain and back three times a week. Each hike the Charge 5 is reporting different mileage. The difference is significant over 0ne mile and sometimes two miles off.\nIt has gone dead apparently or else I died for one hour twice at the time I went to sleep, one hour later it starts to register a heartbeat and record my sleep.\nI have called Fitbit twice, got the old we will get back with you via email with instructions. No email.\n\nI would recommend waiting till they get the bugs out of the software before buying a Charge 5.\n\nNo I am not going to send mine back, my old Charge 3 died a few days before I bought the Charge 5. So I will bite the bullet and hope they remedy the issues soon.\n\nOctober 24th .....\n\nIt died or I did again for 35 minutes last night when I went to sleep. Called Fitbit was given the run around. Finally I was told again that they would contact me via email with instructions.\nI am sure that they know they have a problem but don't want to admit it. Probably working on a fix. So stalling for time. It is also tracking my hikes inconsistently reporting varying distances even though I am always hiking the exact same mountain trail and have been doing it now for 14 years consistently.",

I need to be notified when others are calling me, not when I am on the phone. It's just a distraction, getting notified as if someone is trying to text me, only to see that it is just about the phone call I am on. And the only way to turn this off is to disable call notifications altogether. Thanks, now I won't get the actual useful call notifications. So effectively this is a downgrade from my former fitbit's features.\n\nNow the glitches: I had the same repeated disconnections as a previous reviewer when trying to sync and update the fitbit out of the box. After an hour or so it got updated and things seemed to improve. However I still see the notifications in my app that it \"couldn't sync Charge 5\". It actually does seem to sync just fine but those notifications won't stop. I am hoping this gets fixed in an app or firmware update.\n\nTo summarize, I would give the hardware 4-5 stars.

The issue with most of these companies once they are acquired is to sail along on minimal enhancement and hope that people are too lazy to try new products by other manufacturers.

If you have no plans on paying for the fitbit premium subscription then do not buy this as they are very careful not to tell you that half the features of the watch don't work without it. The health metrics dashboard is part of the subscription so without that you don't get SpO2 monitoring, heart rate variability, skin temperature variation, breathing rate during sleep or 14 out of the supposed 20 exercise routines. There is more outside of the withheld features like not being able to turn off gps(the options are dynamic, using the gps built into the watch and just your phone), location services, being auto enrolled into some social club, fitbit selling the data they collect even though it's not a free product(you MUST agree to this in order to setup the watch) and by default having the watch set to send you all sorts of emails but I guess I get upset about that more than other people these days. If you are still ok with that then I can say the watch itself is comfortable to wear. The screen is a bit slow to respond and the image is on the soft side but it's bright enough that sunshine doesn't bother me. I do have a lot of missed inputs(I can swipe 5 or so times before the watch reacts) and also it will register incorrect inputs like moving down when I swipe right. A smaller gripe is that fitbit can't seem to decide on what material the charge 5 is made from. The amazon page says it's stainless steel but the fitbit website where I originally found this on still says it's made of aluminum. The watch is lightweight though. This is about all I have to offer now. I'm stuck with a watch that won't do half of what I bought it for and in my mind amazon is beyond complacent. Until very recently amazon owned fitbit which makes it seem like this scenario was intentional. I have a product that won't work unless I pay essentially a rental fee(formerly to amazon) and I can't return the near useless product because it's now considered to be \"hazardous\" by amazon. I actually bought the charge 5 as a second chance for fitbit after directly buying a charge 4 from amazon(no third party) and RETURNING IT IMMEDIATELY as I payed for a new watch but was instead sent a used model with a screen that was scratched to heck and gunk left on the sensors from the last customer. I doubt that the charge 5 is somehow way more dangerous than the charge 4 and therefore is unsafe to take back to the warehouse. Both watches were safe enough for the warehouse to send them to me and amazon tried to scam me with the charge 4 but I was able to send that back so the way I see it now is that they just factored that into a predatory business model. I have one last thing before I forget. If you didn't know you can look around the add to cart button and under it you will find the amazon return policy. On first glance you will see that it says REFUND OR REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE but make sure you hover the mouse over it because that is not actually amazon saying that it can be returned. I honestly don't remember if I ever noticed that before but I certainly will remember from now on.",

        "text": "UPDATE May 2022: I'm still a big fan of this product and have made a few updates to my initial review(s), but the bottom line is that it's held up to initial impressions. I ended up knocking off a star just because there are a few improvements that can be made, but it's still very solid.\n\n==============================\n\nI purchased the Fitbit Charge 5 as an upgrade from my Charge 3. I skipped the Charge 4 since I didn't really need/want the new features of that model, but the allure of a color display with the same lengthy, weeklong battery life was enough to make me upgrade to the Charge 5. I won't cover all the features of the Charge 5 since there are plenty of other places that go into great detail, and I may update this review after I get more use out of it.\n\nWHO SHOULD BUY A FITBIT CHARGE?\nThe Fitbit Charge is great if your primary use is as a lightweight fitness tracker. I prefer the Fitbit Charge over the Apple Watch and other smartwatches due to its lightweight nature, weeklong battery life, and my lack of need for fancier smartwatch functionality. If you like the extra bells & whistles of a smartwatch and don't mind a heavier watch that needs to be charged every day or three, then you may want to skip the Fitbit Charge. Also, if you're a die-hard Apple user who needs integration with the Apple Health app, then you'll also need to look elsewhere because there's no data flowing between the apps in either direction; thankfully, the Fitbit app is quite good and does integrate with a number of other apps.\n\nIS IT WORTH UPGRADING FROM THE CHARGE 3/4?\nIt mainly depends on how much you value a better, color display. The MSRP on a Charge 5 is $180 (though, I'm sure the sale price will drop during the holiday season), while the MSRP on a Charge 4 is $150; though, at this point, everyone's selling the Charge 4 (and 3) well below MSRP, especially if you buy refurbished.\n\nIMPRESSIONS:\n- Initial setup was fairly smooth. I had to connect it to the charger to get it started up. Transitioning from my Charge 3 to the Charge 5 in the app was easy enough. There was a firmware update notice (the firmware enables the EDA sensor), and that update was a little buggy & required a few attempts before it succeeded (at one point, I needed to reboot my Fitbit).\n- ECG monitor became available via firmware update 11/9/2021. I had some connection issues while trying to run it but got it to work eventually. I don't have any arrhythmia issues, so while it's a nifty feature, it's ultimately useless for me.\n- The Daily Readiness Score also became available 11/9/2021. It's only available for Premium subscribers.\nIt takes 4 days before it starts functioning & a couple weeks to \"tune\". Overall, I'd say this is not terribly useful. If you work out on a consistent basis & get a decent amount of sleep, then it's always a great day to work out! That is, you'll remain in the Good to Excellent range (30 & above). For reference, I typically work out 4-5 days/week spending 30-40 min on cardio & 30-40 min on weights, which ends up being 110-160 Zone Minutes on those days when combined with whatever other Zone Minutes I rack up when not working out. But if you take a week off or so & return to working out, then you may dip below 30 into the Low score range where it says you should prioritize recovery. I also noticed that if you forget to wear your Fitbit to bed, it can throw off your score; it sent my score plummeting for no good reason otherwise.\nAlso, perhaps not surprisingly, the Readiness Score seems to be primarily reflective of your cardio workout. It will classify my \"Activity\" as \"Light\" on some days when I spend a fair amount of time on weight training that doesn't really sustain an elevated heart rate (and less on cardio).\n- There's no longer a \"home\" button on the side of the display to \"Return\" or access additional menus. This took a little time to adjust to, but I'm generally okay with it, especially since the touchscreen is noticeably more responsive than the Charge 3. Now, you must swipe right to return to the prior screen, and you can also double-tap in most cases to return to the home screen; though, the double-tap can be finicky. Would I prefer to have a \"home\" button again? Yes. (Now, the sides of the device used for the EDA sensor & ECG monitor).\n- The display is much, much better than the Charge 3/4. Brighter with much higher resolution. and of course, color.\n- The display has 3 brightness settings; however, the difference between dim, normal, and max is rather subtle; they're all pretty bright, and this is unfortunate because it's a little too bright for dark rooms in my opinion. I liked the dim, auto, and normal settings on my Charge 3 much better. Hopefully, this is something that will be fixed in a future firmware update (assuming, the Charge 5 still has the sensor that allows for an \"auto\" setting).\n- The \"up to 7 days\" battery life is not a lie. The battery life lasts me about a week with my brightness set to \"normal\", which is the same as my old Charge 3. I do not use the built-in GPS nor the always-on display (both of which are a significant drains on the battery), but I do average 6-8 hours/week of active exercise time. And, since the \"dim\" brightness setting is bright enough for me, I use it all the time, which translates to even better battery life. Pretty amazing considering the brighter, color display.\n- The Charge 5 does a better job of automatically turning the display on at the turn of the wrist. My Charge 3 wouldn't always turn on or would require me to turn my wrist more than what felt natural. The Apple Watch is still superior with regard to automatically turning on when looking since there is a slight delay with the Charge 5 after turning your wrist (and, it still doesn't always turn on).\n- The wrist band that's included is a nicer feeling silicone material instead of the plastic one that came with the Charge 3/4. The \"small\" strap on the Charge 5 band is also smaller than the \"small\" on the Charge 3/4. On the Charge 5, I use the last or next to last notch on the band (i.e. the strap is basically at its largest, most expanded size), but with the Charge 3 strap, I still had 3 or 4 empty notches to work with. Not a big deal since they include small & large bands, but something to consider if you purchase additional bands. I did end up purchasing the Sport band, which does have more notches to work with. Be sure to use Fitbit's sizing tool on their website before purchasing extra wrist bands since they do vary based on which one you get.\n- The heart rate monitoring is nice & accurate like the Charge 3. I run on a treadmill with a Tickr X (1st gen) chest strap, and after the first few minutes of running when my heart rate is more stable, the readings between the Charge 5 & Tickr X are either the same or only off by a bpm or two. It's less accurate when doing sprints/HIIT since it tends to lag behind the Tickr X, but it's still in the ballpark (albeit, delayed).\n- The EDA sensor seems like a waste for me. Along the lines of the guided breathing exercises in the Charge 3, it's just something that I don't care to use, and I question its accuracy/validity anyway.\n- I'm not sure if this was introduced with the Charge 4, but there's a daily Stress Management Score now. The number seems fairly meaningless, since it's somewhat of a mystery as to how it's calculated. Yes, Fitbit tells you what the general parameters are (heart rate, sleep, activity) & premium members get to see how the sub-scores feed into the overall score (see below), but in the end, it just seems pretty meaningless to me.\n- I think this may have changed with the Charge 4, but it no longer tracks the number of floors you've climbed (no big deal as it was wildly inaccurate), and it counts Active Zone Minutes instead of Active Minutes now. Fitbit's website has more details on Active Minutes vs Active Zone minutes.\n- There's 23 clock faces to choose from. Most of them only display one stat (e.g. HR, steps, etc.) at a time (though, you can usually cycle through them all by tapping the screen), which is unfortunate. Hopefully, they'll add more data-rich clock faces, but overall, it's nice to see them making use of the colorful, higher resolution display.\n- The charging cable functions a lot better since it magnetically clips to the Fitbit (like an Apple Watch does to its charger). I believe it's the same charging cable as the Fitbit Luxe.\n- My Charge 5 somewhat regularly (once every day or two) has trouble syncing with the app. It has gotten better over time & usually just requires me to refresh the app (by dragging down at the top of the screen of the phone app). At worst, I'll need to restart the app, and once I had to restart my Fitbit device itself. Overall, not a big deal. Just an occasional annoyance.\n\nFITBIT PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP:\nI generally dislike paying for subscriptions since the cost of them can add up to something pretty substantial over time. The Fitbit Premium Membership isn't exactly cheap at $10/month or $80/year; though, you get 6 months for free with the purchase of your Charge 5. If you actually use many/all of its features, then it may be worthwhile, but for me, it isn't (i.e. I won't be paying for membership when my free trial runs out in a week or so). The Daily Readiness Score & Health Metrics Dashboard are the only premium features I routinely looked at, but I question their overall usefulness/practicality. Here's a rundown of what you get for your money:\n- Daily Readiness Score: see comments above in IMPRESSIONS section - in short, not terribly useful.\n- Health Metrics Dashboard (see attached pic): graphs/data for Breathing Rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Temperature, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Resting Heart Rate (RHR). The RHR data is already available for non-Premium users & you can view you most recent SpO2 reading on the device, but the rest of the stats appear to only be available to Premium members. The graphs are actually kinda crummy; there's two types: 1) one graph allows you to vary the time scale to view 7, 30, or 90 days, but you have to visually line up the dot with the values on the y-axis to determine the actual reading for each dot, and 2) another type of graph shows 7 days at a time with individual readings on the graph, but you can't change the time frame/scale of this graph. It would be a lot nicer if they made these graphs larger & interactive (so you could change the time scale on the fly & tap on the data points to see the reading).\n- Wellness Report: You can generate a PDF wellness report to be emailed. While it provides a summary of HR, weight, activity, & sleep trends over the course of 1, 3, 6, & 12 months, it's lame that you can't just view this directly in the app.\n- Stress Management Score details (see attached pic): extra details on your score including the sub-scores that feed into it: Responsiveness, Exertion Balance, & Sleep Patterns.... still not sure how meaningful any of this is.\n- Sleep Score details (see attached pic): there's a different detailed view of your sleep score; you get sub-scores for Time Asleep, Deep and REM, and Restoration, but I believe all the graphs are the same for non-premium users, so I'm not sure that this offers much more insight that the non-premium view does; I suppose you get to see how much each sub-score accounts for the overall score.\n- Instructional stuff: There are various workout routines, guided meditations, food programs, & sleep programs you can look up & do.\n- Games & Challenges: You can participate in various fitness games/challenges, which might motivate you to work out more.\n\nOverall, I think the Charge 5 is a nice upgrade from my beloved Charge 3, and for me, it was worth paying the extra bucks.",

        "text": " So, if you are like me, you are debating whether to upgrade from the Charge 4. The color screen alone makes things tempting but it is a $180 upgrade. I had read some of the latest reviews and was pretty sure I would order this and return it. Everyone was talking about swiping overload because Fitbit ditched the button. That it was pretty much a color Charge 4. Some of this is accurate but not completely.\n\nFirst, if you are active outside like me (I am a runner), just buy this now. The screen here is more than color. It is very bright and crisp. Easily visible in all light. The Charge 4 is a constant battle in the sun. I would actually have to time when I looked at the Charge 4 to coincide with my trips under trees and in general shade. I am going to guess that this will sound familiar to my fellow runners. The screen is just so much better.\n\nContrary to some reviews, I don't miss the button. I found the Charge 4 button to be unreliable anyway and, with the Charge 5, you now just tap the screen twice and, boom, you are back home. Easy. I am guessing some reviews were written when using a pre-release device. Further, the screen is much faster and more responsive. I would not call it a pleasure to use yet but it is when compared with the old clunky 4 screen. Further, the footprint of the 5 is much smaller and sleek feeling. Just a lot better on your wrist. You will be really happy with the physical device here.\n\nOther than that, this pretty much is the same as a Charge 4. The battery life, waterproofing, and features are mostly the same for me. It will be getting updated with a lot of what the 5 gets here. Fitbit has given the 5 an ECG to help better measure your heart's activity but it isn't turned on yet. For me though, the vibrant more reactive screen and smaller form factor is more than enough to recommend and I do. My only caveat would be if you don't really use it outdoors. If that's you, buy the Charge 4 on sale and take the save. The rest of you should buy now.",

        "stars": "3",
        "text": "UPDADE 4 (final):\nFitbit introduced the recovery score as part of the premium service (means monthly fees). It’s not as good as I’d hoped. Very generic and seems to rely on resting heart rate and HRV only. It’s a bit of a disappointment. I am keeping the 3-star rating. There are better health monitors out there, but this one is well-rounded. (and priced) enough to be a contender.\n\nUPDATE 3: I am just going to sum things up after two weeks of use.\nPROs:\n*Great screen, can be easily viewed in very sunny conditions.\n*Great for working out. Provides extensive metrics as you work out and seems accurate.\n*Very good sleep tracking. Silent alarms (can be setup to avoid waking you up from a deep sleep).\n*Decent heart rate monitor. Step tracker. Calorie count, etc. All these inherent features work well.\n*Holds charge forever.\n\nCONs:\n*No recovery rate metrics, as promised by Fitbit yet.\n*The screen is blinding at night. No way to tone down the brightness.\n*No longer counts stairs climbed for some reason.\n*Does not have actual body temperature readings.\n\nI've learned how to estimate my recovery rate, based on resting heart rate, sleep quality and HRV. Still, wish that metrics was provided by Fitbit, as promised.\n\nUPDATE2: Look like they made the black version FULLY RETURNABLE for whatever reason, so buy in confidence.\nOne more issue to report: the screen does not seem to have an ambient light sensor and the \"sleep mode\" does not automatically turn on. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night to a blinding screen that lights up the room. Not great!\n\nUPDATE1: some have mentioned problems with the device being non-returnable. I followed up with Amazon on the issue. It is returnable, IF you experience performance issues or the device itself is defective or otherwise problematic. It seems like all versions but Black are fully returnable, so it must be a glitch. Talk to Amazon, if you experience an issue. They are extremely helpful.\n\nI am now into the 4th day of testing and it looks like there is some calibration going on in the background, as readings are getting a bit more accurate. I wish the temperature sensor would provide nominal values instead of an evaluation on how much it changed from the day before. I hope Fitbit hurries up and releases the Readiness Score feature.\n\nThese are my initial impressions and I will update this review, as my experience living with Charge 5 allows me to better evaluate it. I have and regularly use Biostrap and Apple Watch. I am mostly interested in my sleep and recovery data and Apple Watch doesn’t do any of that, while Biostrap is useless for tracking workout. You cannot have it all, apparently. I was hoping that this Charge 5 can reasonably handle both tasks in one device.\n\nTo my great disappointment, Fitbit released Charge 5 without the promised Daily Readiness Score, which would basically indicate your recovery score after you wake up in the morning, telling you how your body is really doing, and whether you should go hard or easy on yourself for the rest of the day. It’s a great way to modulate your workouts and properly recover without overstressing your body. The Biostrap is excellent for that very reason (see some of my dashboard pics). That’s what I wanted out of this Fitbit and they didn’t deliver. There isn’t even a timeline for when the feature will be available.\n\nAnother missing feature is the ECG, but I am neither here or there on that one. Charge 5 also no longer shows you how many stairs you've climbed, which is disappointing, since Charge 4 did. After using it for two days, I am noticing that sleep time recognition isn't accurate. My Biostrap gets it right, down to a minute, while Charge 5 can be off by hours. Better turn it on yourself in the settings before bedtime.\n\nSpeaking of settings are adjustments...the lack of physical buttons means that you'll be scrolling up/down/left/right on a small screen all day long. It can get frustrating and menus aren't all that logically laid out. Another things that's poorly laid out is the dashboard, which is supposed to give you a snapshot of your metrics at a glance. You have to go through multiple screens (and some are not easy to find) in the app to get to various points of data. All of that should be viewable on one screen. AND you must use the phone app to view detailed info. Most of it isn't available on the web interface.\n\nAs it stand today, I would rather spend extra $20 and get an Apple Watch SE, which would be a superior tool in just about every respect until Fitbit delivers on the Daily Readiness Score. I’ll have to see how my experience with Charge 5 evolves, but I am giving it very generous 3 start for now…",

It can easily happen that you press something unintentionally, e.g. end a workout.\nAs expected, the displayed calorie consumption is not very accurate, but you can at least use it as a reference.\nThe pedometer is unusable. A few steps are displayed as soon as you get up. However, it is the worst when it comes to motorcycling. After 100 km of driving, 10,000 steps are quickly displayed. In other activities, too, it should happen that steps are recognized, although this should not be the case at all. The problem has been known to Fitbit for a long time, but it is not being solved. They try to keep quiet about it.\nMessages from the smartphone sometimes arrive at the tracker and sometimes not. It looks a lot like a coincidence.\nThe associated app is nothing special; without a premium subscription, there are of course some restrictions.

I went through all the questions the support team asked me, telling me to turn certain features off to prolong the battery life (reducing the functionality to solve the problem seems a daft way of going about it).\nEventually they admitted defeat and sent me a replacement under the warranty.\n\nThe replacement lasted until April 2022.\nAt this point I really considered a Garmin due to the poor lifespan of Fitbit, but convinced myself I had probably had a one off bad experience.\n\nI bought the Charge 5 in April 2022. That lasted until March 2023 until it went completely unresponsive. I went through all the questions with the support team again. They sent out a replacement under the warranty which I have now had a month and the battery is draining at 30% a day leaving it incredibly short of its 7 day offering.\n\nI use the Charge 5 for tracking steps and logging 4 workouts a week, an hour in length.

I've gone from exercising 1-2 times a week to doing sport 5-6 times a week. I'm as fit as I've never been before. I wouldn't get them again though, as I've now reached the limits of Fitbit. I miss good Strava and bike computer support. This is significantly better for colleagues with Garmin watches.\n\nSo - what I really like:\n- the Pro functions in the first 6 months are helpful and motivating\n- the sensors are sufficiently accurate\n- stylish design - calorie tracker in the app\n- easy\n\n- you can change the bracelet, have one made of fabric\n- battery lasts a long time. On a hike in Nepal, just under 7 days without recharging\n- still relatively affordable\n- GPS usually accurate enough for tracking\n\nWhat I don't like very much:\n- First Fitbit after the first swim after 2 minutes is broken. Replacement through warranty. But avoid the new watch for swimming now\n- no live tracking when swimming. The distance and number of lanes are only displayed after finishing and syncing with the app.\n- App only works with the Internet. The app does not work on a plane, without reception or on a remote vacation. Connections were blocked from Fitbit in 50% of WLANs in Nepal.\n- GPS less accurate than cell phones. Running speed is rather imprecise.\n- Too expensive per functions\n- Strava integration rather poor. Only activities using GPS are transmitted. Except interval training - that is never transmitted.\n- no display of the cadence when running; the 15€ Amazfit Neo could do that better\n- no way to transfer the pulse to the bike computer\n- App not suitable for use on a bike\n- Comparison to Garmin: no estimation of competition pace/competition fitness, no V2Max display, even if a sensor is actually available, no music function\n- will probably only work soon with a connection to Google account That's a lot of criticism now.\n\nI actually like the watch and would miss it if it breaks again.

This was not the case with the previous models.\n- The recorded data, such as resting heart rate, activities, HRV, etc., are generally good for training control - but I am missing a presentation of this, e.g. I would like to see the trends of all recorded data in a diagram to see, for example, the ratio of training load and resting heart rate or HRV.",

This time, however, it is different, because the Charge 5 has nothing more than the 2 unlike the competition that has evolved in the meantime. Furthermore, this time the watch does not have a button to press if the display does not turn on with the simple movement of the wrist (and I assure you that it happens almost always) so sometimes I can't see the time, to monitor the pulse while I work out... the touch has a very low sensitivity, it's a pain every time I have to scroll through the options. I do not recommend this product, I have regretted it. I didn't make the return convinced that it was a matter of habit but I was wrong.",

        "text": "I HIGHLY DO NOT recommend this device. From the very beginning, I have had nothing but technical issues with it. Within 2 days of activation, the battery completely drained. When I recharged the device, the screen froze, then went black. The user manual and help section of the website were useless and contained insufficient information (if any) to correct the issues. Eventually internet research and the experiences of others provided trouble-shooting suggestions. These suggestions included turning off nearly every feature that Fitbit boasts as unique to its devices. What then, is the purpose of this device? With these features turned off, the battery lasts about 5 days - which is okay, but not great. However, other technical issues persisted. Nearly every week, I needed to reset the device with the charging cable. The screen would glitch like a strobe light, freeze or blackout entirely. The device often had issues syncing and connecting to Bluetooth.\n\nAfter a few months of this, I finally gave in and requested a placement through the warranty. Customer support was helpful and the replacement arrived fairly quickly. However, they sent the replacement via GLS to a pick-up location in a town 30 minutes by car from my address. The company did not even try to send it to my home (not usually an issue) or even a pick-up location nearby. This is not a reasonable process at all. Customer support also did not advise me to keep the charging cable and band. The replacement device is only the watch face. Fortunately, I had kept these. After charging and activating the device, the exact same issues began immediately. Fed up, I contacted customer support regarding a potential refund. After enduring more trouble-shooting advice and offers of another replacement or a 50% on a new Fitbit, I had to reiterate my disappointment/dissatisfaction with Fitbit and that I refuse to continue. My only option now is to contact Amazon to see if I can return it. We’ll see how that process goes…\n\nOutside of these tech issues, the device and Fitbit service simply do meet expectations. I chose Fitbit based on its claims for sleep accuracy (I have a severe sleep disorder, sleep data is crucial) and blood pressure / oxygen saturation monitoring (chronic side-effect of the disorder). The monitoring features are not accurate at all, which makes the device only sufficient for the basics (steps, activity minutes, etc). For this, I would have purchased a much less expensive device. I also wanted the community aspect of the topic groups, group challenges and connecting with friends who have a Fitbit device. The companies recently eliminated most of the community features. And of course, most of Fitbit’s features are behind the pay-wall of the app subscription.\n\nPersonally, I am going back to Garmin. The device may be more expensive upfront, but most features are included in the device and app price. I found the tracking as accurate as its competitors and it suffers from far less technical issues.",

For example, EDA scan, seems pointless, the ECG just tells you you have normal sinus rhythm, and points out, that adverse rhythm can be very intermittent, so it is actually more beneficial to monitor heart rate and SpO2! So again, pointless, unless you have serious heart concerns, but if you do, it's very unlikely you will have a fitness tracker!\n\nThe GPS is a nice feature - except it can use your phone for this, to save battery life - so why have the GPS, unless you don't want a phone with you, which unless you are an occasional runner, is unlikely!\n\nAnyway, it tracks well, is consistent and when comparing heart rates on cardio machines, seems accurate. This is all great, it is what I wanted it for. The sleep tracking is really informative, but to be honest, unless you are an insomniac, you are not really going to be changing much in the way of habits via a tracker!\n\nBut they are all features we like and use. The problem with charge 5 is two fold - firstly, the strap is silicone, but not breathable. This means, when you sweat, it may rub up and down your wrist, this causes rashes and they are not nice! I ended up using the charge 5 on one wrist for half the day, then the other wrist for the other half, to try and reduce this, but still it caused discomfort! It may be something skin gets used to, but after 2 weeks, it was still a problem for me, but I do have sensitive skin.\n\nThe biggest issue though, is the battery life. For the first 7 days, it was great, barely dropped 10% per day, then after this, which bizarrely coincided with signing up for fitbit premium, the battery life dramatically dropped, first to 50% per day, then as of this morning, it has dropped to 90% in one day. I don't have GPS active, all exercise apps are turned off, the screen isn't constantly on and I don't have animated screens. and apart from signing up for trial Fitbit premium, nothing has changed! I bought this because it was a good price point AND it was better battery than the Samsung watch 3/4, which has reviews about terrible battery life. I might as well have gone for the watch 3/4 because this is appallingly bad and for no reason!\n\nIn this day and age, with the sheer amount of investment in research on tech and with the investment from Google as well, quite frankly I find it awful that this is what Fitbit consider a leading product. It is no better than cheap versions of trackers and I decided, with one week of the window left, to return the item. This is incidentally why I buy from Amazon, because it is no hassle return and this is a huge factor when purchasing something like this, because as we know, no matter how good your research and the reviews, until you get it, you just wont know!\n\nThanks Amazon for your customer service - shame on you Google/Fitbit for your poor and shoddy product!",

Although this isn’t always accurate. Some food items when scanned come up with totally different nutritional information to what is on the packet. I have knocked a star off as the screen is very easily scratched, despite it being Gorilla Glass. I have a couple of minor scratches without knowing I’d done it. Also the strap as others have mentioned really doesn’t agree with my skin and has caused some sore areas on my wrist - see pics. Will be buying a different strap. Something to bear in mind if you have sensitive or allergy prone skin.",

        "text": "For the most part, the device has been great. It had some issues with the screen turning on randomly at first, but a firmware update fixed that. The battery life was over a week, it could charge in a couple hours from nothing, and the band was so comfortable I did not notice it was there... or not, when I might forget it on the charger.\n\nHowever, whilst sitting at my PC getting ready to head to bed, I felt something funny at my wrist and looked down to find the screen had fallen off. I tried pushing it back in, but there are no little nubs to latch into or anything... just a really cheap glue. However, in the process of getting to my office to get some glue, thinking I could fix it, it tore a bit and the screen no longer worked. I think the fact you can tap on the screen, and it is a separate entity from the rest of the band (not encased as a unit like the Charge 2 is) that this fault is just waiting to happen.\n\nLuckily, a quick chat on the official Fitbit site provided a swift means to getting a replacement. Just beware of this issue in their cheap manufacturing before you buy it. My Charge 2 lasted longer and is still going strong (backup until replacement arrives). Hopefully the replacement lasts me until I am ready to get a new band... and maybe from someone else.",

In addition, the closure and unclean processing lead to skin irritation within a very short period of time. Ah, you have to reorder other bracelets (that's also intentional, the things are exorbitantly expensive compared to the material value).\n\nTouchscreen\nThe screen is small but sufficient for a pure tracker. Various watch sheets can be displayed via an app, but their design and readability can be disputed. The touchscreen reacts a bit sluggishly, especially when you switch to swim mode, you need several attempts to unlock the screen again.\n\nDetection of sporting activity\nThe automatic recognition works quite well, compared to other products such as Withings or Apple, there are fewer sports that are recognized. However, the GPS is not switched on, but that is due to the app.\n\nFitbit app\nThe app was considered the gold standard for a long time, but it is also the weak point of the product, as it URGENTLY needs to be reworked. First of all, units on the treadmill are not correctly recognized, the same applies to an ergometer, where a workaround must be selected with a workout or elliptical trainer in order to get calorie tracking at all.\nYou have to set the sleep recording to “sensitive” to obtain reliable values, otherwise you can expect many interruptions. There is no progress recording of SpO2 saturation per night to identify and warn individual apnea phases, only an average value is calculated and displayed in the morning, which is also very poor and actually gives zero information.\nThere is also NO recording option for blood pressure and blood sugar, i.e. neither a product in the Fitbit series such as a portable cuff, the integration of a Bluetooth-enabled device nor manual entry is possible. This is precisely what would be important in order to track training efficiency.\nIt is also incomprehensible to specify the form of the day - I was shown an excellent form of the day even though I was exhausted from training the previous days and vice versa a bad form of the day even though I was rested and fresh and was able to train in the performance range. Quite a bit of humbug then.\nThe EDA function can be described as what it is: It is “Eh there” - keep your arms and hands still for three minutes and breathe quietly, that's it - the meaning and effect are questionable and can be used more for calibrating skin conductivity.\nThe ECG function also cannot be evaluated in the app, despite Premium. You get neither a measurement value nor a graph display. The Charge5 does measure well, but what good is it if you can't do anything with it. Even a 1-channel measurement under load would be better than nothing, especially for people with heart failure or other heart problems who want to exercise - even without approval as a medical device.\nReporting for the family doctor is missing in the app and on the dashboard, the promised export as PDF is missing (even with Premium) or is hidden in such a way that I can't find it. Overall, using the app takes some getting used to.\nThe motivationals, i.e. the various trophies, are very nice, but pretty pointless. There may be people who motivate themselves with it, but it quickly gets used to it and you ignore the whole thing.\nIt would have been desirable if there were real modules with which you can expand the app, but most of it was already activated and there were no more additions, even with the Premium.\nSince most functions are not implemented correctly, all that remains is to switch to other apps and install them. When it comes to data protection, this is of course an absolute disaster, as it makes it impossible to track who can see everything in the most personal data.\n\nSupport\nYou are referred to a chatbot whose information is modest. In most cases, you only find out what you already know about the device and the services. The bot is also extremely slow and misinterprets the question. That was more than disappointing.\n\nSummary/TL; DR\nThe product itself is good but with significant weaknesses. If you want to count your steps, this can be easier and cheaper. Sports tracking is fine for outdoor sports, but it doesn't knock anyone off their feet. The recording and evaluation of vital signs is inadequate. The stress and sleep functions are largely useless. The app and premium services are insufficient. The support is not good. The premium services are pure bag tailoring.\n\nConclusion\nQuite nice to get started, but it doesn't come close to the products of other manufacturers. Within three months, you'll throw that thing in the corner and get something different and better.",

Fitbit GPS were never the most accurate but it did the job.

I did read reviews of the poor built in GPS, but decided to take the risk anyway as I'd be running with a phone mostly so could use that instead (spoiler: I regret this).\n\nPros:\n- Comfortable and unobtrusive, easy to take on and off\n- Battery life excellent, multiple days no problem and charges fast\n- App is really good, responsive, fast syncs etc. No complaints.\n\nHere's where we get into the Cons:\n- GPS. Awful. Awful. Awful. Built in GPS is a joke - you get an extremely jagged map of where you ran, which makes it inaccurate. Fine you might say, just use the phone GPS which I run with anyway. Well that's a mess. Constant drops where you are looking at the watch and see a red icon and \"connecting\" text. Is there anything more frustrating knowing you've been let down.\n- Fitbit Support. Their first port of call is to \"loosen the strap\" to fix the issue and not having it touching your wrist bone. But that has the effect of not tracking your heart rate accurately or at all. Then they encourage you to do a factory reset. Sigh.... But that does not fix it.\n- Step tracking. How does one wake up, look at their watch and see they have walked 60 steps without even getting out of bed? It massively over-estimates steps and therefore calorie burn. Super frustrating.\n\nI don't understand how Google has not kept their high bar for customer experience through to Fitbit. It's clear there are major issues with this product. I should have read the reviews in more detail and not taken the risk sadly. Avoid this product. Maybe the higher end ones are fine but for £99 I expect better.",

Battery life --I have charged a few times and so far fine. I turned off most notifications since I don't like those (just me, I also turn off notifications from most other apps). Sometimes sync catches itself up ---a couple of times, but not nearly as manual or as many times as the previous one started to get older. Overall a good upgrade. However, I don't like the fold under strap as much as the \"normal\" watch style ---but that is preference - maybe I am older and set in my ways about wearing style ---my wrists were pink beneath because of it but I have loosened and the pink is fading. I am not sure it is counting some activities, but I am still learning it so likely human error on my part (and, I have short attention span when it comes to figuring that stuff out). Charges quickly ---although the very specific charger for this---they change chargers every release which I don't know is necessary except a sales twist that each charger only goes with each watch or whatever ---can't be certain (but other companies do that, too). However, this is a good enough watch for my needs and I like it better than any other tracker brand of its type and affordability level and I have tried (and returned) a few other brands. I am not a full on fitness person, but I do exercise daily and check heart rates and sleep info etc.",

They also teach me a bit more about what my body is doing where we don't have a lot of time in doctor's appointments these days. A bonus of the watch is its alarm and smart alarm features. The latter attempts to wake you are a more appropriate time in your sleep cycle - practically this means waking in upwards of 30 minutes earlier than your alarm but this is not a bad thing if you wake up alert. The vibration of the watch is also a nice change in comparison to my normal iPhone alarm. The watch face is stylish, and it currently replaces any other watch I own.

The timer function is also practical, with which you can discreetly (e.g. in the gym) set a vibration alarm (no more is possible with feedback). The payment function is more tailored to the US market; in this country (as of November or so), there are only a few, rather exotic banks with which the device can be linked. So not a substitute for Apple Pay or Google Pay. The quality of sleep can also be recorded and evaluated, including various graphical representations, so that you can objectify why you feel so sleepy in the morning, or ideally, well-rested.

My original intention was to get a tracker that was as small and compact as possible, which I only wear when exercising to keep an eye on my pulse (I never really paid attention to that before). But things developed a bit differently because... I now wear the Fitbit around the clock. It is very comfortable to wear, very compact, light as a feather, looks modern and does not disturb the wrist. I now track my sleep and my pulse throughout the day, track my weight there with a Vitafit scale, log all sporting activities (some are also automatically recognized) and use the Fitbit as a.. watch. What I really like is the data that you have collected, for example, after a challenging mountain tour on an MTB or after a relaxing round on a racing bike. I particularly like the presentation of the heart zones (fat burning, cardio), which gives you a better sense of how the training carried out affects the body and allows you to optimize your training plan. The app/dashboard is absolutely great, very clear and customizable. The “dial” design can also be changed. In addition, there are a few tools such as the timer, which I regularly use when exercising. The battery lasts quite well and even after 3h sessions on an MTB in the mountains, there is still enough capacity for the rest of the day. I was skeptical when buying it for now, as the Fitbit is in the cheap range at €100. But I'm really excited so far. I can only recommend giving them a try to anyone who likes to exercise a lot and wants to pay attention to themselves a bit.",

Unfortunately, you have to look carefully to see that you have to add another 9 euros/month for the app subscription and you also pay with your personal details, quite expensive. Can I understand data or euro, but both?\n\nOnce you've bought the part, mine has no choice anymore, agree or it won't even start. This should also be communicated in the ad.\n\nWhat he can and how well I can't describe as well as the many reviews and videos that already exist. But I can agree with that. Sleep monitoring reflects my impression that when I feel fit in the morning, it also does not indicate that I slept poorly. Pulse repeatedly matches 1-2 bpm with my upper arm blood pressure monitor.\n\n- Addendum: When moving, the pulse is often significantly off. When hiking in the mountains, the displayed heart rate in Charge 5 quickly rises to 120+. But when I put my finger on my artery, I just count 85-90 beats.\n- Some of the app's evaluations are already quite questionable and, even worse, are not revised even after feedback in the forum. For example, with exactly identical measured values, the sleep index is 90 in one week and 80 in the next simply because the resting heart rate was 4 beats higher in the first week and the measured values during sleep were therefore automatically lower more often than in the following week, where the resting heart rate was 4 beats lower.\n- What does the EDA scan have to do with mindfulness, please?\n- The pedometer simply counts too many mistakes. 500 steps when brushing your teeth, 500 steps when cutting onions, 2,000 steps in half an hour riding a bicycle,... this results in barely a day under 20,000 steps.",

It works almost useless and considering that there were so many other things to optimize, I would say that Fitbit has cut a hole in the water.\nBut given that the app is slow and redundant, with the features placed at random, difficult to find and with many functions that are useless, one could imagine that the smartwatch software was not optimized, it was that it remained slow and devoid of many features that even 30-euro smartwatches have.\nBut now let's talk about design. A very small display, in color yes, but which looks like something seen 4 years ago if not earlier, with an always-on display that drains the battery like a leech, when today there are bands that last even 10 days with an always-on display. A 'patented' strap closure system, which should be innovative, but which is only uncomfortable when you rest your wrist on a surface or while you sleep.\nAt least the NFC payment system works well, but honestly, considering that Charge 4 is 100 euros cheaper, I would say that Charge 5 is practically to be avoided.\nObviously, the same goes for the more advanced Versa and Sense smartwatches, which are nice doorstops.\nXiaomi remains at the top, supported only by Apple Watch.",

This does actually track quite well. However, I can lie in bed for 2 or 3 hours after waking either mulling things over or reading my kindle...I know Im awake, but my fitbit registers a lot of it as sleep.\n\nThat said, the app itself is pretty good and tracks a whole host of lifestyle attributes although you do need to make a lot of manual entries for things like food/drink etc. for accurate tracking of calories.\n\nIt can be useful for text or messenger notifications though as they show up on the fitbit without the need to access the phone - just need setting up prior to use.\n\nAll in all, I use the fitbit but not to its true potential as its too much of a bother to continually update the app (I dont have my phone in my hand all the time). Because of the inaccuracies of the sleep monitor, I do not wear it to bed as I find it a little uncomfortable.\n\nOverall 3 stars as I dont find it useful for anything other than telling the time and alerting me if I get messages.

I think the size of the screen is also perfect as if it was a bit bigger it would have not fit perfectly to my wrist for accurate monitoring.\nI would probably give it a 4 or 5 star out of it if it was just this considering it's a cheaper solution for activity tracking, which does what it has to.\nHowever, the interfaces you can choose are very narrow and you can't customize it anyway you like. Which I don't understand in a digital smart tracker..\nAnd the biggest negative is date format is US and you can't change it. You read it right, you can't change it. There is a request in Fitbit forums made almost 2 years ago to support EU date format but it still is not there..\nIt's not acceptable to not have EU date format in a digital screen.

You have to sync the watch to your phone at least once a week, otherwise the watch ends up between 40 and 90 minutes out. This happens on both watches. The time issue is corrected once sync’d but still very annoying.\n\nBought my partner and I the fit bit charge 5, as a way to monitor our activity and keep us active.\nMy first warning would be to not use the free 6 month subscription. The fit bit subscription service is a total con. It provides you with data other watches provide as standard but effectively if you keep the watch and subscribe for two years, it’s cheaper to get an Apple or Garmin Watch, which are far better devices. You’re also paying for your own data, so it just makes no sense.\n\nHowever, ignoring the subscription and if you get the watch in the sales (I.e less than 100£) like we did, then it’s a great basic tracking watch. It’s step counter isn’t 100% accurate, but I’m not sure many are, it is however a good indicator for whether you’re at least close to a decent daily target of steps. The watch screen is lovely and bright, however the raise to wake function just doesn’t work, you end up having to tap it or shake your wrist 9 out of ten times to get it to wake up. This is the same on both watches.\n\nIt’s sleep tracking is also temperamental/ lacking accuracy. We have a newborn baby who needs feeding during the night, so we’d expect our sleep scores to be pretty low. We get around 70-80 scores as it doesn’t register that we were awake, when we were, or the fact that we were at points walking around the house.. if we just took the data from the watch, we had a great nights sleep, where as the reality is very different!\n\nOne of the watches has also already frozen, needing a full reset. Not a great start for longevity. The other has also disconnected twice from the phone.\n\nOverall, it kind of sums up our experience to date with fit bit, we’ve found them to be quite hit and miss. Example: we’ve been on the same walks together and one will have a full GPS route mapped out and the other won’t, same with connecting and syncing with phones, every so often, the watch just won’t sync and this has happened to both watches.\n\nThe app itself, is a lovely and well thought out app, with easy to locate and read settings and the data it gives you is plenty to make positive health choices and get active.\n\nAs a cheap tracking watch we’re very happy with it. If you want something of better quality, better features etc. then avoid. If you just want to track steps, log dog walks and the odd bike/ride or swim and you’re not that fussed if it only tracks 80-90% of it properly, and you’ve got around £100 to spend on a ‘smart’ watch, then get the fit bit, it’s a pretty good tracker at such a low price point.\n\nAnother annoyance we have found though is around clock faces, there are no nice ones. Also when tracking an activity, you can’t get back to the clock face, so it no longer functions as a watch.. you have to end the activity to see the time again.\n\nWe’re happy with our purchase and would recommend them to those just wanting a cheap tracker, but if you’re tracking PBs, or the price is above £100 again, then maybe avoid as there are far better available.\n\nBattery life is around three to four days but much less when tracking activities like walking. So far the shortest has been just under two days before needing a charge. There’s also no warning about low battery, and we’ve found that we have to plug the watch into the charger to find out how much battery is left, or check on the phone. Although the phone isn’t always automatically sync’s so this can be misleading.",

I decided to get to the bottom of it so I bought a couple of bands and currently doing a comparative test between the Fitbit Charge 5, Honor Band 5, Mi Band 6, Amazfit 5 and a random cheap one called Bingofit. I also bought a Realalt 3D pedometer and another digital pedometer. I'm also counting steps manually using a tally counter. When outdoors all the bands are pretty accurate (within 1% of each other and the pedometers) but when at home the Fitbit overcounts by about 50%, honor +20%, Mi -20%, Amazfit +10%, Bingo -30%.\n2. The small selection of watch faces on the Fitbit are also pretty poor and they don't give me the step count without having to swipe.\n3. When in exercise mode the watch face is not customisable and it gives me a bunch of useless data but not the basics I'd need - steps count and the time (I do a lot of walking - my main goal is to hit my steps and keep track of the time).\n4. One time I was arranging clothes at home and it thought I just had a 20 min swimming session.\nReadiness score also seems bogus, it told me I was in great shape to hit the gym after a night where I only got 4 hours of sleep. Whereas today it gave me a score of 1 despite sleeping well, just because I exercised yesterday. Needless to say I ignored it and smashed it in the gym this morning.\n5.

It also locks onto satellites easily and works well with the app. I have to keep an eye on the charge level as it does not seem to tell me when the battery is getting low. On the Charge 4 always got a email notification but perhaps I have not set this up properly.. I also notice that it does eat the battery on long rides when running the gps so always make sure it is well charged. A defiant improvement on the Charge 4.",

I bought several of these trackers for my kids. Children under 16 years of age cannot set up their own account in the app, but may only have a child account in a family account. What does that mean? Well, I had to set up my own account first, even though I don't have a tracker myself at all. Then I added the kids as family members. So far, so understandable. But now the problem started: The child accounts can only be used with Fitbit Ace bracelets! Charge 5 cannot be connected to such a child account! Fitbit's support just “shrugged it off” and said “that's the way it is.” So everything back again, and the dates of birth of my children a bit backdated so that they can set up their own accounts. That worked out then too.\n2. The pedometer is insanely inaccurate. Just shaking your arm makes the pedometer jump in air. Absolutely incomprehensible with a product in this price range!\n3. The GPS is only used if you turn it on for a specific training period. If you want to use the daily route as a reference instead of the absolutely useless pedometer, you will unfortunately be disappointed. This is not based on GPS, but on acceleration sensors. The same sensors that supply the inaccurate pedometer. Conclusion: USELESS!\n4. The support is pleasantly in German, but only provides you with ready-made answers. Individual questions are not addressed.\n5. Unfortunately, the app is extremely confusing and faulty. Apart from the fact that the Fitbit app crashes again and again, I don't understand how you can even publish something like that. When I remove items from view on the app's dashboard in Edit mode, I can't add them anymore. They're gone forever and ever. The statistics also take a lot of getting used to.\n\nCONCLUSION: The tracker is very nice and practical on the hardware side. The battery life also leaves nothing to be desired. However, the software, in particular the app, is barely usable.",

However, since I really like the FitBit app, I switched back to FitBit. For just under €100, the offer for batch 5 was tempting. Design and wearing comfort are definitely guaranteed. What I'm missing in comparison, like many other users, is the altimeter. It is a pity that this was not installed in the latest model and is also not displayed by the app (altitude meters are recorded via GPS, but not displayed). Furthermore, the GPS signal is often very unstable when used via a mobile phone. By using the integrated GPS, the battery is drained very quickly. All in all, a recommendation, but with urgent potential for improvement!",

Apparently, however, this is not recognized. The first few days I managed to do that without any problems.\nWith the EDA scan, on the other hand, it doesn't complain about, but seems to recognize that I have my fingers on it.\n\nIn addition, the touch display no longer responds as well. When I try to swipe left to get to the activities, the display jumps only 2 steps further from e.g. “steps” to “calorie consumption”, i.e. as if I had tapped on the display twice.\n\nIt often happens that I end up in some menu item that I didn't want, and therefore, for example, start an activity without wanting to, because I simply can't get out by swiping,\nor that I end one even though I wanted to pause.\n\nI hope that it is more of a software bug that can be fixed with new firmware, but I am rather disappointed that way. Sometimes you feel like you have a 5 Euro fitness tracker from China.\n\nAddendum: Today I tried to start an activity for 20 minutes, but then I gave up. The touch hardly reacts anymore. Up/down is sometimes possible, but right/left nothing happens.\nSo the Fitbit is really useless and will probably go back",

Yes, floors are no longer counted, but there is an ECG, a temperature measurement and sometimes absolute O2 saturation as well as a stress detection function. And all this even without premium. I have now tested this once without premium!\nBattery life of 7 days also works; at least if you do without GPS from the Fitbit.\nIn my opinion, you get a lot of technology here for comparatively little money.\nOf course, you can argue about what it is good for; but I find it very motivating to keep an eye on the values for many years to come.\nWhen it comes to data protection, one can only hope; but we are all so transparent now...\nAnyway, I'm thrilled!",

Sometimes it records, sometimes it doesn't. When measuring, the deviation from the HF meter on the training device is sometimes up to 30 beats. This also makes zone recording useless.\n\nI would like to have the display “always on” during sports. The setting completely ignores the part. The display is fairly easy to read - but not in motion. And especially during training, you also want to see what you do.\n\nWhether the GPS signal is found or not is also a matter of luck. If so, the recording is relatively accurate. But not every time.\n\nThe pedometer already registers steps when you are sitting motionless at a desk. Despite the premium function, the app does not evaluate any training progress. There are far too few sports. Even when cycling indoors, the thing absolutely wants to connect to GPS, otherwise it won't record. It is a tragedy.\n\nThe whole thing is a bitter disappointment.

The built in GPS is pretty handy too as a backup, although it’s not accurate and does burn down battery fast (I’ve previously had connection stability probs with some phones). The price has also dropped to something more sensible since I purchased mine so the overall value for money is reasonable.\nIt also seems to have [more than I can count…] new features that I have no interest in if that’s your thing.\nA major issue with this tracker - the material used in the strap can cause really nasty rashes if you wear it for more than a day or so, you may need to spend more $$$ on a fabric replacement. I found the stairs climbed/altitude logging interesting/fun for day-to-day monitoring and cycling which now seems to have been removed. The screen can still get activated by your sleeve whilst exercising in the rain and pause, or even end your workout (I thought they’d addressed this - there’s a water lock but not obvious how to for general workouts).\nOverall - I’m not feeling this was much of an upgrade, Fitbit seems more concerned with fashion branding, pedling premium subscriptions and feature packing rather than focusing on solid, basic functionality; I'd likely try and alternative brand in future.",

But the Garmin required near daily charging and eventually conked out - my belief is that watch tries to do too much.\n\nI also think you’re better off with a strap type design than a watchface one, especially if you’re swinging your arms around catching barbells, dumbbells or kettlebells. Watchfaces dig into your wrist causing discomfort and pain. The strap design avoids that.\n\nSo I returned to the simplicity of the Fitbit charge 5 and I’m glad I did. I like the app better than Garmin active. The charge 5 now benefits from displaying more notifications from your phone too.\n\nThe main con is that you cannot link it up to a chest heart rate tracker device like you can the garmin, but I find the in built wrist tracker on this fitbit is adequate enough - the reason I got the chest strap in the first place was because the garmin in built wrist tracker was really poor at tracking heart rate during exercise. The fitbit is not 100pc accurate either, but it’s far closer to the chest strap readout than the garmin was.\n\nOne other note, non gps workouts (ie those that are not running, walking or cycling) don’t go to strava automatically - but you can sync them via a third party website - check that out via google.",

I bought it mainly for the ECG function, but also to support my fitness regime with data. That includes walking and cycling. I love the detailed summaries and insight. It is motivational and great feedback that is relevant and guides progress. But that's where the issue surfaces because you must choose either between accurate heart rate or GPS, but not both. I found a YouTube video that explains why and it is to do with the position of the GPS antenna, which is at the bottom and side. For accurate heart rate the watch needs to be firmly fitted, but, that hides the antenna, which means that the signal gets lost and tracking stops. The only solid solution is to choose the option within the watch settings which uses the mobile GPS. There is also a dynamic setting, which switches between watch and mobile, but it seems logical that if you have your mobile GPS tethered then best to use it full time. So this means that the watch needs to be tethered to a mobile for GPS tracking as for me I want accurate heart readings. For me I always have my mobile for music and calls, so I am happy to accept this flaw. Apart from that anomaly, the watch is excellent value and I'll not be returning it as the ECG and other functions really are very good for the price.",

It's wonderful not to have to use the GPS on my phone! Battery life is reduced by GPS use, but I think one charge of battery is good for over 5 miles of GPS. I have discovered that playing tennis gets my heart rate into cardio but walking only gets it to fat burn! I guess I don't walk fast enough!

Once updated, I then had to go through it all again to set it back up on my phone and I’m guessing I’ll have to do this every time there’s an available update.\n\nIt’s not working inline with the Strava or MyFitnessPal apps, not as I would expect.\n\nReally disappointed as I now need to try and find something else in place of this.",

My Huawei P20 Lite got stuck when updating the clock face on the first day and no amount of reinstalling could fix it. I eventually solved the problem by installing the app on my Samsung tablet, I am not sure if I could have fixed it any other way. Then, after a week, my free six month trial of premium stopped working and I am still trying to resolve the subscription problem with Google Play. On the plus side the 24 hour heart rate monitoring, sleep scores and activity tracking have been helpful to me while managing rehab/fitness after some recent health problems. This is my first smart watch so I cannot comment on how it compares with the competition.\nUpdate, 27th October 2022 - a new version of the App was released which has made everything far less useful. Heart rate monitoring now has tiny graphs that cannot be enlarged to full screen or viewed in landscape mode. I also have concerns about accuracy, I have a low heart rate for medical reasons; the Fitbit watch displays accurate readings in real time but the records in the App always seem to display slightly higher results - this seemed to change when they \"improved\" the app.\nLots of features are hidden behind a paywall with a premium subscription, given the poor performance off the app I am unlikely to continue paying when my current trial expires; in fact I may be looking for an alternative smart watch that better meets my needs. My original review gave 4 stars, after 4 months of use I am downgrading this to 2. Such a pity as the technology is great - its just that the app developers seem to have a very poor understanding of what their customers want.",

The fact that some functions are only available with a paid subscription, which comes into effect automatically after the trial period has expired, might have been another point of criticism, but unfortunately I can't really judge whether this is justified because I haven't tested the functions. Unfortunately, this will no longer happen.\nAfter a week, I lost that too, again from my wrist.\nI was able to find it again on the basis of the synchronization, but unfortunately a car has already driven over it in the paved parking lot. The display is now gone and the device is useless.\n\nFrom my personal repeated experience, I therefore generally do not recommend a wearable whose clipped wristbands can be released from the case very quickly only by slipping on the wrist. I prefer to freak around forever to change a bracelet if I don't run the risk of losing a 130€ device all the time.",

Better watch YouTube videos of tech tubers instead of Amazon reviews, where you often tend to review if you're dissatisfied: P\n\nI find Charge 5 quite chic in itself, it's certainly state of the art, but: I'm tattooed on both arms, full sleeves, also on my wrists. There is a lot of black color on the left - that's not what the light sensor of Charge 5 does, which uses the light to check the blood composition and reads heart rate (not the same as “pulse”), oxygen saturation, etc. - sleep detection is also based on this, together with some other functions. Since black absorbs most of the light directly, the tracker unfortunately doesn't work on very dark tattoos. After I returned the first tracker (in this case unjustified) and received a new model, but it didn't work again, I was completely stumped. It was only my wife who came up with the idea that it could be due to the tattoos.\n\nI have worn the tracker on my right arm for a while, the tattoos are brighter - the heart rate was measured correctly, the rest was still not. Steps were counted, but were set far too high. 280 steps were counted in the morning, even though I just stumbled out of bed to puss, haha:D The calories probably consumed were also completely absurd - 600 calories for 50 minutes of strength training is easy too much by a factor of 2.\n\nWell, sent back, it doesn't help. With little hope, I bought the black Withings Steel HR Sport, it costs the same as the Charge 5, and the Withings app also connects to MyFitnessPal - and lo and behold, everything works, exactly. They probably installed a better sensor then. However, the Withings is also “earlier”, haha, it's just an analog watch with sportswatch functions. Heavier, but more chic.

        "text": "UPDATE: downgrading to 1 star. On top of all the below GPS is off by 300m on 5 k run in comparison to other devices and phones (especially if you live the road and run on the footpaths), battery dries inconsistently on the same running course and can go from 25% to 0 in no time. and there are even more bugs to what's described below (for instance today I've had black screen of death just when I was going to go on a run). FitBit should be ashamed to charge £100+ for such a poor product.\n\nVery very disappointing. Firstly, let me mention that my \"high\" usability standards were set by MIFit4 which I used for several years and it was like 10 times cheaper.\nThe good: device itself is very nice, gathers a lot of data, quite accurate when tracking activity, battery is decent and depending on how you use it will actually last longer then 5-7 days suggested in the description. For my liking default setting of vibration is too strong and there's no possibility to tune it down (only up)\nThe bad: User experience and testing was done by people who should be banished from software development forever. If this group of people were asked to design a WC room you'd find urinals upside down and toilets on the ceiling. And none of that would flush. Also I don't think any of them did any sports. Ever. Let me give you several examples:\n1. Running app - you have a choice of setting a goal of 1,2,3,5,10,20 and 40k. I normally run between 5 and 10k. is it too much to ask to be able to select 8? or 13? How about a buzz every kilometer to inform me on my progress? again too much to ask? it’s buzzing like crazy with every heart rate change but almost ignores the distance.\n2. Mobile app for this device is a separate story - it's literally USELESS! Max you can do with it is change the display view and see some stats. That's it. ok, also some fency training programs, sure. But a lot of user journeys lead you to the same place and that place does not resolve your problem. Or how about being able to set an alarm on the devise from the app? Set a running goal? being able to reinstall any program (it’s not the case for most of them). How about telling me my pace and distance via headphones while I run? It’s sooo much more convenient! Apps for waaaay cheaper devices are perfectly capable of doing that, but not this one. Maybe it would be slightly less frustrating if fitbit wasn’t that bugy!\n3. Stopwatch and timer. It's funny that I even have to white about it. Both DON'T really work. Think about it, you are buying a £100+ device that has a problem with such basic things. Stopwats doesn't buzz in the end. I literally have to stop it manually and only then it decides to buzz. Time increments in 2-3 second steps, turns the screen off and then doesn't want to come back on, so if you are stretching on the floor you are screwed. You need to use your other hand to tap the screen to light it up and every other time it will stop the timer. At some point in time the timer disappeared from the device all together, I had to reboot derice 2 times for it to come back.\n4. Bugs, bugs everywhere... today I was running 10k, at 8,5 mark the device said that the battery was 7% and this notification wouldn't go away. So for another 1,5k I was trying every trick in the book to get it to show me distance and pace but nope, screw me - 7% is all I've got. Naturally missed the mark and only when I've stopped it decided to show something else. Synced it with the app, it suddenly became 12%. Sometimes when swiping through the device it will get stuck in one place (like ECG or stopwatch) and refuse to move or go back to the main screen. It can last for seconds or for minutes. Same with activity reminders and other notifications or just random screens. And I could go on and on and on about these things.\nThe Ugly: Fitbit clearly does care more about marketing then about actual user experience. There’s a lot of hype about it but in the end you are buying yourself an endless source of frustration for £100+. I will be checking if I can still return it at this point as it was used already.",

It is all the more egregious therefore that the Charge 5 is such an absolute nightmare. I will outline why...\n\n- The side button has been removed and so one is entirely reliant on the touchscreen to wake the device up. This would work if the touchscreen was any good, but it does not function anywhere near as well, as say, an Apple product. So to wake it up one either has to repeatedly hammer the screen, or perform a theatrical flick of the wrist. Half the time the device cannot even function as a reliable watch. In addition, because of the sensitivity of the screen to drips, it is near impossible to use it in the shower or swimming pool. This was also a problem with the 3, but the side button meant this could be partly overcome.\n\n- The syncing. The syncing with the app is extremely unreliable. It is 0945 now, I have been up since 0530, and I still haven't been able to sync. However - and this is quite the achievement - it is possible for the device to endlessly and repeatedly display iOS calendar entries from yesterday.\n\n- The ECG function is difficult to use and can only diagnose one abnormal rhythm. Pointless.\n\n- The pulse oximetry function provides some sort of derived overnight average, but not a real time reading. Pointless.\n\n- I don't know what an 'EDA' scan is but it takes three minutes to do and one has to grip the device the whole time, so no thanks.\n\n- The colour screen is good, but is there a clock face that shows hours, minutes, second and doesn't look terrible? Nope, there is not.\n\n- Can the watch recognise and active GPS for a long walk? Nope.\n\n- The previous feature that counted flights of stairs climbed was good, but of course that has gone from this version.\n\n- The device thinks it can tell you when you are stressed. This is delusional. There is no need for this kind of pseudo-scientific nonsense.\n\nIn summery, basic functionality has been overlooked in favour of bells and whistles that serve little to no purpose.

So I went out on a limb and bought the Charge 5, which, of course is much cheaper and not directly comparable. What I found surprising and very pleasing was that everything worked from the start. The set up was easy using the existing Fitbit app, the upgrade to the 5 was seamless, all the functions are working and it looks good on the wrist. The only reason I have given a 4 for accuracy is that I simply don't know how accurate some of the functions are eg ECG and EDA scans. I know that the Sp02% reading differs slightly from an oximeter I have at home, which gives a blood oxygen measurement. However, the Charge 5 is not a medical instrument and I am happy to use it to obtain a general awareness of my health. So far, I am very pleased with this Charge 5.",

In addition, the calories burned are not displayed in the apple symbol, the calories still available are incorrect. In the case of the drinking volume of water, the target of 2 liters reached in the evening is still displayed, but by the next morning the last two glasses indicated are “forgotten” and only 1500 ml are displayed. But if the necessary app for a device that is supposed to promote fitness and balance is a source of constant anger and frustration, one star is actually too many. I cannot make a purchase recommendation. You are better served with a cheap tracker without an app, saving frustration and hassle and a lot of money.\nAddition: For 7 years (!)

Such things as Breathing Rate, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), and others are measured automatically during the longest period of sleep during the day.\n3. If you want to download/export detailed data, be prepared to dive into programming (for Fitbit web API) or provide your credentials to third-party tools with no privacy guaranties whatsoever.\n4. Ridiculous price for Fitbit premium subscription and accessories. Don't get fooled by 6-month \"free\" period included in the offer. As usual, there are special conditions (in this case - pay for a year - get 6 months \"free\").\n5. GPS is useless. During the exercises, you are to use either the Heart Rate Monitor or GPS, but not both at the same time.\n6. Fitbit Pay does not work everywhere (including the country I live in).",

I bought the tracker at the end of November and I thought that the Heart rate measurement was completely inaccurate, so I decided to contact the costumer service and after trying any possible solution they sent me back a replacement that actually is working fabulously. So a great positive feedback about the costumer service that was very fast to solve my problem.\n\nAnyway, to simplify I will do a little list with the positive and negative aspects of the tracker.\n\nPositive:\n\n-It is reasonably accurate compared to professional devices for tracking heart rate, steps, distances and sleep while compared to other fitness tracker it is excellent\n\n-The battery life is great, I manage to do 8 days despite daily training with the GPS in dynamic modality\n\n-There is the ECG reader\n\nNegatives:\n- The straps are horrendous. I had a pretty bad irradiation on my skin and they smell like a corpse after each training\n- The ECG is a gimmick. The atrial fibrillation is usually an arrhythmia that cause a very fast and irregular heart beat but the tracker cannot do an ECG if your heart beat is more than 120 bpm. This means that it is almost useless.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fitbit Charge 5 is very good. Excellent heart rate, steps, distances and sleep tracking compared to other fitness trackers. However, the choice of the straps is questionable considering that I am not the only who suffered of skin irritation. Same thing about the ECG, what is the meaning of this feature if it is pretty much unusable to catch an atrial fibrillation when it is needed?",

So far, so good, you would think - everything worked out at first. A message then came up that the firmware was not up to date. Trusting with blue eyes that this should not be a problem - after all, this is not a problem with other wearables such as Whoop or the Apple Watch - I initiated this. Something seems to have gone wrong, now I only see a white line.\n\n“Well, let's start all over again” - I thought, decoupled the choice again and wanted to start everything from the beginning. Admittedly, I didn't pay attention here, because of course you have to enter a four-digit code when coupling - which I can't see thanks to the white line.\n\nOk, it wasn't the best moment of my use of wearables, but there will certainly be options for a soft or hard reset. So I read my way across the net and see that this seems to be a problem that was already there with the Fitbit Charge 3. And people everywhere claim that “pressing the charging cable button three times” would help. I can't confirm this - and I think I've tried it frequently enough to be able to say that. So it's bullshit.\n\nSo you turn to Amazon and Fitbit support. At this point, I have to praise the Amazon support, which has really taken care of my cause. Despite a detailed description of the problem, Fitbit Support sent me a general answer according to the motto “Make sure that it's plugged in”. This, as you can find confirmed in the Fitbit support forums, has quite method.\n\nThe last experiment on my part is that I let the Fitbit Charge completely empty in the hope that such a hard reset will be triggered. Fun fact on the spot: Since then, it has been vibrating every five minutes. In terms of frequency, this is about as pleasant as the high-frequency sound at the dentist. I had to bring the Fitbit Charge to the other end of the apartment at night so I could sleep - and I'm currently enjoying the regular buzz while working. If that doesn't work, I will correspond to Amazon's offer and send the wearable back. I'm going to lay the money back because after such a ridiculous experience and knowing that this is apparently not an isolated case, I can't trust the Fitbit company.\n\nWhy do I continue to give two stars for something of this kind of defect? First, because the mobile app makes an acceptable impression, I am convinced that the product would be really good if it wasn't junk. Second, in my experience, one-star reviews are taken less seriously than two-star reviews. So that I don't sink into the fever swamps of bashers, who like to write reviews with more exclamation marks than letters based on their own fanboyhood regarding other products, I give this one star to the company. Who knows, the Fitbit Charge will probably be usable with constructive reviews.",

It clocked me at 168bpm slicing mushrooms in the kitchen (it wasn't going over 70). Other times you can be brisk walking and it won't pick up any change in heartrate until you stand still for around 60 seconds - sometimes longer; this means you won't get accurate data at all on the go. It'll tell you your heart rate was 100+, but because it's so SLOW to change to what your current heartrate is whilst exercising, it's a guess, and a bad one at that. And believe me, none of their advice fixes the rate at which data updates.\n\nYou might think it's worth a punt based on the price, but if you want any of the useful data you have to pay a subscription for it (not a cheap one either for what you get, there's absolutely no reason they should charge you the price they do), and with something this inaccurate I gotta say they really should reconsider the whole thing. No way I'm paying for it when my trial ends. They cover themselves by saying it's not a diagnostic/accurate medical device, but its selling point is quite literally monitoring the heart.\n\nThe wrist straps are bad, and they're gonna be whiffy. No amount of purgatory will cleanse the unholy stank of death if you plan on wearing this daily, you know, like a watch. I've cleaned the straps on this thing more times than myself.

At the moment, I still need a certain amount of health monitoring in everyday life, and short pulse peaks, e.g. when getting up, at the beginning of an effort after rest, etc., are essential here. After a pulmonary embolism, my body is still spinning a bit, which is shown in such peaks. About 1 week after the embolism, I switched to the 5 series, and I was initially happy about the good results, but did not match my state of health. So I wore both watches at the same time, and I noticed the differences in measurement. Such spikes also occur, for example, in venous gymnastics. The 3 shows pulse 130, but the 5 only shows 90. That's why I wear both watches in parallel, even if the 3 has the well-known display damage, which is getting worse and worse. The higher readings of the 3 are correct in my opinion, because I countercheck them with a pulse oximeter in between.\n\nHowever, with longer uniform pulse changes, walking, running, resting, sleeping, etc., the measured values again appear similar, even if the 5 only shows them with a delay.\n\nThis is not a Nedicine device, but I still find it essential that a successor model does its job so poorly. And it's not exactly cheap.\n\nBy the way, the Charge 3 and 5 functions are similar, respectively, without premium. So I won't buy Premium, the free basic scope is enough for me.",

The interface can be a bit temperamental - sometimes it's impossible to get it to wake up.\n\nThe app on the phone is good, but I feel it overpromises a little. When you start there's loads of stuff about wellness, meditation and heart health. But as you start gathering data from the fitbit, none of that stuff really seems to actually change based on the data gathered. It's all from manually entered data. So I'm not sure what the value of it is.\n\nIn terms of setting simple goals like steps, activity minutes and distance tracking, it does it's job wonderfully. I just think they might be overpromising a bit with the marketing and app. It doesn't do anything particularly special. It just does the basics really well and they've added lots of bells and whistles to justify the price point.\n\nGood points: The battery life is excellent. The strap is comfortable. The device itself is slim and light. The app is intuitive and easy to use. The goals and exercise types make tracking different sports/workouts easy.\n\nBad points: A little pricey for the actual tech delivered - you're paying for brand, which is ok for some.

I haven’t tested the GPS though which on the charge 4 drained battery shockingly. I use the app to log GPS. The syncing is slower and glitchy with the app but gets there eventually. My only gripe is that the best screens have an American date order on them which is annoying. This can’t currently be changed so you end up searching for a screen that has day/month date order and this is not obvious so you have to change it before knowing whether it is US or not.

That's why I can judge the bracelet correctly and compare it with predecessors. So let's go!\nPositives:\n1. The bracelet is stylish, fits perfectly on the wrist and very light;\n2. The display has the same colour and is very easy to read, touch screen works smoothly, the screen protects Gorilla glass - is absolutely sufficient for normal use;\n3. work;\n4. Charging the bracelet has become much better and easier compared to Charge 4 (not a clip, but a magnet);\n5. 6 months of premium membership is free;\n6. Visa payment always works smoothly.\nNegatives:\n1. battery lasts less than with Charge 4 (before it was about 7 days, with a new bracelet just under 4);\n2. clutch to the mobile phone is sometimes problematic (about 1 out of 3 clutches it doesn't work - annoying);\n3. Functions: - GPS has strong deviations from the mobile phone (just like with its predecessor), pulse measurement is a bit got worse (I always compare with a professional heart rate monitor, with the new bracelet you have to pay a lot of attention to the bracelet position (there was no problem with predecessors), recognition of sports exercises has become worse;\n4. Although the silicone bracelet has become softer, in my opinion, has become more uncomfortable;\n5. Membership is free for 6 months and then? Why do you have to pay for normal services? The same services (evaluation of your health values), but free of charge, are offered by several manufacturers of competitor brands.\n\nConclusion: if you want to look stylish and know a little more about yourself - then the Fitbit offer is made for you! If you are a passionate athlete or even a semi-professional - then you better look for something else.",

I'm very happy with the screen and have found navigating the device straightforward despite the lack of any physical buttons.\n\nIt's quick and easy to start and stop activities. The Fitbit analytics and app continue to get better. The ECG and other touted features are now present, but weren't at launch and lots of folks were bothered by this.\n\nThe HR recordings come in a bit lower than the Charge 3 HR that this device replaced. My peak during runs has dropped from 160 to 140 and I don't think I've magically become fitter.\n\nThe battery life is great when not using the always-on display. Coming from earlier Fitbits I haven't felt the need to have the display on all the time.\n\nUnfortunately the device locks up few days showing 5 dots on the screen. When this happens you need to plug the device into the charger and perform the magic reset button press on the USB adapter. It usually takes about 5 attempts to get it to restart despite having very simple instructions. A good number of users report the same problem in the Fitbit community forums. If it weren't for this issue, I would have been delighted with this device.\n\nI have found trying to get a resolution to this issue with Fitbit extremely time consuming. Each conversation is like starting afresh and you get different stories each time you talk to them (\"yes we know about this\", \"no we don't know about this\", \"we can't talk about this until you send another photo with a handwritten case number\", ...).

In fact, I chose the Charge 5 over the Luxe because reviews promised an altimeter but apparently that sensor has been removed so no floors or accurate elevation tracking is available, which is a massive bummer.\n\nThe heart rate tracking seems to be off or lagging behind during excercise, I just did a 20min cardio session (one from FitBit Premium, no less) and it was still showing \"fatburn zone\" when I was about pass out, then jumped straight to \"peak\", but then the app logged it all wrong (no cardio zone minutes), even though I was really happy to see after the video that you can add it as a workout on the app with a click of a button. Also, this morning it registered a \"17min swim\" while I was getting ready for work, no idea why... So overall, the exercise tracking is not great compared to the Charge 2 that I was used to.\n\nThe Charge 5 also seems to count significantly more calories burnt during the day with less excercise/fewer steps than the Charge 2 would, so I'm going to have to up my daily targets to account for the difference...\n\nI'm yet to take it on a run or bike to test the GPS but after the initial impressions (had it for over a week now), I don't have high expectations.\n\nSome positives:\n- Battery life is decent so far\n- Colour display is pretty (but I can't seem to find the option to set 24-hour clock which is super annoying!)\n- Active/zone minutes are counted immediately, and not only after sustaining the elevated heartrate for at least 8-9 minutes, which makes it easier to hit my daily targets (and harder to \"cheat\" by just moving my arm to add steps lol)\n- It has some extra sensors so there are more health metrics and some cool personalosed insights (although I would swap any of them for an altimeter!)\n- The readiness score is a really good feature (but only available on Premium)\n\nIf I could go back in time, I would consider buying the Luxe or even the Charge 4, because after having the Charge 2 for ages, the latest addition to the FitBit family has been a bit of a letdown...",

Now I like sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring and app too, but now for swimming, unfortunately the charge did not deliver so well...\n\nIn turn... Track length set, alway-on display on, started... let's go. The screen lock is automatically activated while swimming... And that's where my problem begins: I take a break every 500m and therefore want to pause time accordingly at the batch as well. I can't because I don't have a chance to turn off the screen lock in the water. The part says “double tap” but doesn't respond to it. Automatic pauses cannot be activated for swimming. I don't know if I could pause the training at all or start a new one if it worked... Probably the latter. But so my breaks are added to the swimming times and my time per 100m becomes 3:! 0 minutes instead of 2:02 minutes. A swolf is not determined, nor is the swim type determined. However, it counts the tracks correctly. However, the pulse values in the water are significantly too low and therefore a failure.\n\nSo the batch unfortunately has no use for me and is declining. If the product description could tell which data is being collected, I could have saved the whole thing... Garmin can do that too - why not Fitbit?\n\nMaybe again in a few years... unfortunately here it goes back... Incidentally, I find the price-performance ratio quite good due to the quality of the sleep and pulse data (outside water) and rate it accordingly differently than others so far...",

Sleep tracking is pretty much what I think. The battery seems to be holding out properly and can be charged quickly. Unfortunately, it was already for me. I'm very disappointed and that's because of the following: ekg function? Unfortunately, today was negative. skin temperature measurement? No information despite 24 hours of wearing, ergo doesn't work. eda scan? Basically has to be assessed manually and doesn't do too much. Oxygen measurement when needed? Unfortunately not possible, an average is calculated, unfortunately that doesn't help me much. I will return the watch as I promised myself a lot more of it. I stay true to my scanwatch, which gives me an ECG, a sp02 measurement at any time.",

You have a choice of set clock faces but there is no way to display your choice of always on data. The EDA scan seems pointless.

        "text": "Device Looks/Comfort:\nThe device looks nice, it seems to be built well and the strap is fine, it didnt build up sweat, rub or make my skin feel itchy as other watches have. It is comfy to wear however with all hardware it is managed with software. my issues with this device come from software and the FitBit support teams.\n\nSoftware:\n-- No ECG on launch and still no released at the time of writing this.\n-- FitBit studio. There is no way for developers to customise watch faces, create their own faces or make apps as FitBit refuse to add this functionality to charge series.\n--Sp02 not on clock faces\n-- No constant stress monitoring\n\nSupport Teams:\n- After talking to support teams they had no idea about a majority of questions i had, Its like they have no been trained on anything other than to tell users to reset and repair the device upon any issues that occur.\n- They didnt know about the charge 5 device in depth or know what the studio was.\n- After alot of hassle i was finally able to get in contact with a \"specialist team\" to discuss it. However you cant live chat this \"team\" or talk to them on the phone. The only way to contact them is via email in which you get a reply maybe 1 once a day if you are lucky, reply instantly as an email comes in ? well you still will wait till tomorrow for a response.\n-- Talking to the \"specialist team\" was more frustrating than the regular support team. They made the conversation go in circles requesting information and then dismissing , misunderstanding, or providing false directions whilst im being direct and clear in my questions and/or requests. eventually they referred me to the community forum, expecting them to help me instead. The community however have no involvement in this software, so cannot help, and the only part of some use in the forum is the feedback/feature suggestions. Except it really is no use at all, They reply to every suggestion with the same copy and pasted message subtituting the users name and thread issue to thank them for the suggestion, and to see how many \"votes\" the community give it. Then you dont hear any follow up on it.\n\nDevice Usage:\n- All data collected has to go through Fitbits server. So having extra data analysis, such as your sleep score + Deep/Rem/Awake times, will require you to purchase a premium subscription.\n- Always need to have it connected to your phone, As the device cant store the data for very long, so forget about long runs using built in gps while leaving phone at home.\n- 23 clock faces are avaliable in the app, you must use the app to swap faces, you cant do this from the device and no extra faces are avaliable to download or be created, with no interest from FitBit to create more even though there is many community requests for this and no interest from FitBit to give studio access to create your own. The current faces in many opinions are ugly (with the styles and/or colours used) and/or dont show all the info many want at the same time. majority needing to tap threw the data to display or leave out some data points all together.\n- ECG isnt avaliable, but is advertised, somewhat discretly, as coming soon and even then wont be avaliable in some countries.\n- No control for music including spotify\n\ntldr;\nPros:\n+ Comfy and no noticable, even wearing 24/7\n+ Battery life, Can get many days usage without worrying it will die\n+ Responsive screen\n+ Build quality\n+ Charges fairly quickly with a magnetic charger\n+ Apps on device seem to work as intended, i did not experience crashing or glitches.\n\nCons:\n- No Sp02 reading on faces, This is done seperatly in an app, But i dont believe its live data, I think it just shows the latest data from the last nights readings, as this is recorded with the sleep data.\n- Stress monitoring is done by making you hold the sides of the device for 3mins. It often will complain about this, by not detecting you are holding the sides, interrupting the 3mins and needing to resume or restart the readings. Then finishing with asking you how you feel. This seems as if it is trying to learn ? why doesnt this just give a predictive stress level constantly ? who knows why they decided to do this is anyones guess.\n- No ECG app\n- No Fitbit studio support, This is not a device for developers.\n- Premium subscription is needed for indepth/extra data for some sensors and for more than just live data.\n- Limited to stock, ugly clock faces\n- No music control\n- Limited storage for sensors/gps, always needs to sync with phone.\n- FitBit has the Worst support teams i have ever encountered on a \"premium\" device\n\nFor me having this as a basic tracker was fine but i firmly believe when you buy a device then it is yours, having restrictions that limit your usage and experience is very much a dealbreaker. Having to try deal with support was a nightmare and further reinforced me having to look elsewhere.\n\nI requested a refund on this product as a result.",

The 6-month premium is only available under certain conditions, you have to specify how you would like to pay afterwards and actively cancel it. Kind of scam to beautify these 6 months for free like that.\n3. The device automatically detects cycling and jogging. Workout, for example, but not. You might be able to add this somehow. But I have not found detailed instructions on how to do so far on the net.\n4. Does not show weather Not possible for batch 5?\n5. I find sleep recording inadequate. My old Samsung wristband was much more realistic when it came to sleep.",
